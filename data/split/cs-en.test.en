we now have as many as 20 cross-border cooperation projects , the latest being the projects between the czech republic and germany and between slovakia and hungary .
i vote in favour of lifting mr lisek 's immunity , firstly , because it will help him , and secondly , because this is the only way in which he can respond to the accusations made against him in his home country .
a 2 % increase in milk quotas is needed to allow europe to respond to increased market demand .
besides having no experience of the required tasks , she has a highly dubious past as national treasurer of cnd .
i am sounding this alarm bell because the european union 's institutions are the romanian people 's last hope .
there , unfortunately , i have to say that three member states have not yet responded .
finally , i must thank the commission , as represented by the commissioner , for its readiness to cooperate , as also demonstrated by its departments , and also mr barnier for the way in which he continually corresponded with parliament , even before the formal start of the french presidency .
that is not to say that we are one hundred percent happy .
like the author of this report , i believe that cooperation to protect the fragile environment of the arctic , the interests of its inhabitants and the development of the region is very welcome .
in this process , the commission will , indeed , continue to inform and involve the european parliament in a transparent way .
we must set up either a compensation fund or an insurance fund to which the oil companies themselves would contribute .
i congratulate her on the report which is based on her vast experience as a medical practitioner and which introduces a balanced strategy on the sustainable use of pesticides .
i consider the ten-t networks to be an important factor in achieving an efficiently functioning single market .
development cooperation represents a very important part of eu external relations .
the commission 's amendment proposes :
on the other hand , genuine measures and investment aimed at waste reduction have not been forthcoming at all , and a distinct industry for processing recyclable materials has yet to emerge .
( de ) mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the house much prefers dealing with expenditure to revenue - and so it is to mr staes ' great credit that we are today turning to the trifle of revenue for once .
we in europe realise that restoring the financial markets to normal conditions of operation depends largely on the american financial market returning to normal .
your organisation , mr caldeira , provides an essential service for european taxpayers .
kosovo itself is not sui generis , but the establishment of a military base in kosovo is .
we need a bit more time for that and i would suggest that i come back either to this house or to the committee to inform you of the result of the analysis and also give you a precise report on the next steps .
furthermore , it is very difficult to ban all trans-fatty acids completely without creating other risks to public health .
the preparatory process leading to the conference was particularly complex , with a significant number of countries having serious misgivings about the process in the light of what happened in 2001 .
opening of the sitting
this does not necessarily mean more or stricter legislation and rules imposed by the eu .
implementation of the rural development programmes from the period 2007 to 2013 has only just started but i find that member states ' first programming is very promising and i am confident that biogas-related measures will be among those with the highest uptake in the area when we talk about bio-energy .
however , millions of people are being abandoned to hunger , thirst and sickness .
embedding our policies in the needs and opportunities of rural society as a whole will create a multiplier effect that will also benefit the whole agricultural sector .
its integration will also mean eliminating , or making an important step towards eliminating , the grey zone in south-eastern europe .
i do not think that anyone here would doubt that fisheries management must take account of sound economic principles .
at this point , however , i believe that more than financial support , this sector , like other industrial sectors , requires rules , and requires , as has already been pointed out , genuine reciprocity .
thus efforts to create a single integrated energy market are increasingly resisted and europe 's objective to reduce its dependency on foreign supply sources becomes almost unreachable .
in future , the new fund 's geographic and thematic priorities will need to be clarified to make it operate more efficiently .
the initial aim of this proposal was to simplify and improve the existing regulatory framework for the labelling of textile products .
furthermore , i would like to compliment mr seeber on his work .
what i have in mind is not only a common eu position on many issues , but also specific joint action and practical intervention aimed at mitigating the effects of the financial crisis .
that is why the enhanced ability to switch your supplier is so important .
it is for that reason that we are now about to revise it .
i also take this vote of confidence as a sign that this parliament agrees with the ambitious agenda that i am presenting for europe over the next five years .
we have to wait for the us and other stakeholders in the process to inform us of their plans , and that is what we intend to find out about at the meeting with mr obama 's administration in prague in early april .
otherwise , we will replace the current national boundaries with the blocks ' boundaries , thereby extending without any justification the deadline for implementing the single european sky .
for example , we should strengthen our community method which is based on the treaty of lisbon .
we can only judge these elections when the electoral law is published and when we see if clear and fair arrangements are in place for the ballot .
it is a fact of life that our children are often more computer literate than we are .
secondly , it is also a success for slovakia , which successfully met all the membership criteria and will be able to benefit from the advantages of a common currency .
thanks to investment in research , european union firms in this sector enjoy a leading position on the world market and contribute in large measure to job creation and greater competitiveness - two major objectives of our lisbon strategy .
in my view , the proposed periods are reasonable .
mr president , baroness ashton , you are appealing for calm .
firstly , to firmly and wholeheartedly support the process of democratic transition and the political reforms in those countries.secondly , to carry out a critical review of the european neighbourhood policy in a way that strengthens the democratic clause .
rather than solving the problem of pollution , this directive exacerbates the inequality between member states by placing a greater burden on outlying countries such as portugal , which are exporters but are not crossed by major transport routes .
madam president , in reply to ms estrela , i can assure her that the problem with my country is that we have given up self-government and we are members of the european union : that is my country 's problem .
treatment methods used leave much to be desired , too .
i would like to use this opportunity to call on the eu and its member states to use its full economic and political influence to speed up the regime transition in burma .
today , 50 % of the southern mediterranean population is under 18 , and in less than 30 years , we will have a free trade area that will be made up of nearly a billion consumers and citizens .
finally , it is regrettable that the eu foreign ministers failed to agree on the clear condemnation of sectarian attacks against christians in egypt and iran .
any form of openness and transparency regarding the misuse of eu funds can only be for the good .
poland has applied for support for 594 redundancies in the podkarpackie region .
many individuals , even in the village down the road from me , are still out of their homes .
these interests are increasingly being defended by military means , and with ever greater aggressiveness .
documents received : see minutes
since we are a small nuclear country , we are used to being subjected to a relatively greater number of international tests than is the case for other nuclear power plants in the larger countries .
commissioner füle also mentions this .
the lisbon treaty will bring us these instruments .
it should be replaced by a resolute policy , including credible warnings that future cooperation with russia requires an immediate improvement in russian law enforcement .
for this reason , we place special emphasis on prevention ; this explains our day for the eradication of poverty on 17 october , as mrs záborská has pointed out .
instead we should concentrate on creating a dialogue that would give us a chance to present our position while not treating the other party with disdain .
i congratulate the rapporteur .
i voted for this report since its goal is to promote the active citizenship , social inclusion and solidarity of all young people .
it is also important that mamuth , who would actually prefer to live his new life in the netherlands , is given a decent basis for comparison , because this young man has the right to see how various matters are dealt with in greece and the netherlands , or wherever it is that he wants to build his life .
it is about the market and the retail market , but there is something more , something in addition , which is the issue of rights , enforcement , consumer complaints , and how to devise a more relevant policy .
however , we also need a european reaction force to coordinate the scientific and medical work and to establish control plans .
my second example is the via baltica expressway project with all its attendant environmental problems .
in writing . - we vote against the motion for a resolution 'the commission 's 2009 enlargement strategy paper concerning the western balkan countries , iceland and turkey ' by gabriele albertini , because we believe that neither turkey nor the former yugoslav republic of macedonia shows any progress in meeting the copenhagen criteria , nor do they demonstrate any political behaviour which would allow them to become eu members we hope to improve their efforts in order to meet the accession criteria , a fact that will be examined in the future .
there has unfortunately been very little time to reach compromises or for real debate on some of the issues - hence the large number of amendments .
the economic front shows a total reliance on the oil sector , difficulty in attracting foreign and even domestic investment , and lack of job creation opportunities .
thank you for your attention .
harmonisation or streamlining of disclosure and distribution rules would be a costly and disruptive process .
2007 has , i believe , been an important year for the community harmonisation of private international law in the field of civil and commercial obligations .
what i mean is that we have to be fair in the sense of maintaining the eu perspective as the critical driver of reforms in the country , keeping our word concerning turkey 's chance to show that it will be able to meet eu accession criteria .
i appeal to my fellow members to send out the signal that it is no longer acceptable for women to have to live under these conditions .
on this point , i want to stress the importance of child care facilities .
we are obliged , and it is our responsibility , to define the guidelines that are going to guarantee the sustainability of the seas , fisheries and , in short , the planet itself .
full traceability of products throughout the supply chain is another key point for guaranteeing the ability to withdraw defective products from the market , even as they are being produced .
that is what it says on the voting list .
president barroso , thank you once again .
but within regional cooperation there is also a possibility for projects to be brought up .
we have heard some extremely interesting views , and i welcome them .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , energy is the subject of the century .
we must not forget that increasing numbers of young people are getting deep into debt without even suspecting what effect this will have on their lives .
the second block of problems is concentrated in heading 4 , and here i would like to mention three elements : additional resources for kosovo and palestine ; the emergency aid reserve , especially as there will be needs requiring a fast response this year and next year ; and of course the upcoming donors ' conference to help georgia , and here - at least today - we do not yet have a decision on the table .
i think it is a good thing that , amidst the commotion that has preceded this debate and to some extent surrounds it now .
we are making things too easy for ourselves if we simply also define the more prosperous regions as requiring particular support .
however , the outcome of the parliamentary procedures and especially of the trialogues with the council has provided us with a text that i personally consider unsatisfactory ; sensitive parts and some important aspects of the text submitted by the committee on the internal market and consumer protection have been removed by the council , and overall the final text shows signs of a struggle between different basic approaches to the issue .
reducing the proportion of hungry people by half is therefore , rightly , the first of eight millennium development goals that the global community promised to reach by 2015 .
i support the idea of creating a system which will allow the eu to set the maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination to ensure a high level of protection for the general public 's health , following a nuclear accident or other radiological emergency .
if they want to avoid the worst , europeans must be united to prepare the best .
the european council also looked at more immediate challenges .
we europeans must finally seriously come to terms with our shared responsibility for these grave violations of human rights .
i believe that the added value of the political agreement reached should be seen as important , above all since it calls on the member states to introduce a quality management system for their maritime authorities and to comply with international rules in this area , the most important of which being those resulting from the international maritime organisation conventions .
this is not only an economic problem , but is also a violation of human rights .
we have seen how useless the previous stress tests were .
tackling these problems calls for a broad approach , combined with effective implementation of the principle of free movement .
for us in the group of the greens/european free alliance and in the committee on employment and social affairs here in parliament , there is no doubt at all .
before any other considerations , we must therefore emphasise that this directive 's main objective is to eliminate any obstacle to the liberalisation of railway transport by harmonising railway safety legislation in each country .
we very much appreciate that .
ten years later , we can conclude that progress has been made .
mr lewandowski , please do not place too much trust in the member states .
secondly , i believe that this package must also integrate a convincing 2020 strategy .
since the candidate meets the requirements set for filling the post of ecb president , i would also like to express support for his appointment to this role .
the new procedure will thus be based on the principle of mutual cross-acceptance of authorisations already granted by a member state , for which the necessary additional certification will be little more than a pro forma .
at the same time , the commission will work on sector-based initiatives aimed at making better use of public contracts , and at promoting objectives such as those contained in the europe 2020 strategy .
europe 's influence is not the same in all these countries , and europe is not equally attractive to all of them .
this is why we must take notice , and why we should improve these circumstances in particular .
it is a bit hypocritical to say that responsibility always and only lies with institutions and never with those who have chosen to inflict this behaviour on society .
if there is one lesson to be learnt from mr havel 's speech , it is how to be modest and how to be realistic .
directive 2001/83/ec , which sets out a community code relating to medicinal products for human use , provides for a harmonised framework for the advertising of medicines at a community level , the application of which continues to be a responsibility of the member states .
as you know , we faced a similar situation three years ago , in 2006 , and this is more or less a recurring annual problem , as each year russia increases the prices of the gas it exports to its neighbouring countries towards market levels .
vice-president of the commission . - mr president , please bear with me because i will try to respond to our three rapporteurs and the ombudsman .
it goes without saying that the radically different legal systems and traditions must be respected and reconciled when ensuring the functionality of measures that have already been introduced .
on behalf of the alde group . - mr president , first of all congratulations from the liberal and democratic group on your election .
( fr ) mr president , i , too , wished to speak in this debate , since it concerns a subject that i have been following for a long time .
the taxation of savings and criminal law in the area of fraud would be standardised .
( ro ) i , too , wish to say that i am appalled by the way in which the law we are discussing is presented .
since this directly concerns my responsibilities , it is worth recalling that the commission provides substantial funding to humanitarian organisations whose projects aim to provide vital assistance and protection to palestinian civilians .
the conditions were that the films would be viewed by 18 october of this year and only those members who had seen all three films could and should vote under this budget item initiative .
i have no doubt that sanctions need to be applied flexibly , but at the same time the rapporteur also points to the inadmissibility of double standards .
i would like to thank the rapporteur for his work , and you for listening .
on the other hand , the quality of the eia process itself could be reinforced .
very finally , i have not made any decision about opening a delegation in iran .
it is a european problem ; it affects the security situation in europe .
this is not adequate .
i think that beyond the profiteering issue that mr goebbels has quite rightly raised , we have to deal with a lack of transparency in the internal market for petroleum products .
we all know that patient information about medicines is a controversial topic .
these proposals , which strengthen each other , as many of my fellow members have said , will enable us to make a decisive move in favour of the quality of the european maritime sector , and also , ladies and gentlemen , its transparency .
i will be there next tuesday , commissioner .
the eu should reduce the risk of civil accidents by providing assistance to search-and-rescue operations within the framework of the european integrated maritime policy .
this means that meps will not have to move to strasbourg 12 times a year , but 11 times to incorporate 12 sessions in strasbourg .
therefore , i support the rapporteur 's call for the commissioner to now set about revising the international agreement , and we must also set to work at eu level .
( sv ) mr president , we are living in difficult times .
madam president , my proposal is that the words 'iranian authorities ' at the beginning of paragraph 3 should be replaced by 'appeals court at its hearing of 12 may ' .
a good tax system relies on a fair and broad tax base and reasonable levels of taxation .
if , for example , the commission proposes a reduction of 10 % for the post-2010 period , there will be a problem .
however , i would like to highlight the efforts made by the workers and their estimable desire to serve europe and spain .
we take note of the idea put to us by the ever witty mr evans .
this will be a discussion to be followed with interest .
on behalf of the ppe-de group . - ( hu ) thank you , madam president .
there was more discussion of increasing the amount of land available for soya production and deforestation to gain more cultivable land ; even our delegation had not paid much attention to the topic .
the truth is that they neither respect the irish , nor democracy .
it must not be used instead of legal acts in areas for which the community has legislative powers .
so , who is resisting this ?
to those of you here in this assembly with doubts , i say : look at how your own countries have developed !
secondly , special attention should be paid to women , as they account for a higher age bracket than men due to the increased life expectation .
it refuses to implement the financial transaction tax and eurobonds and its eyes are glued on the rating agencies , which did not see the subprime crisis coming , which shows just how reliable they are .
this means cooperation between parliament and the council , the latter of which , indeed , appears to be absent .
we hope it will not be needed but we have made that preparation as well .
in this connection , i wish to take the opportunity to ask the commission and the council a very straight question : do they agree with - and would they support - a move to allow homosexual couples to have the right to adopt children in the same way as heterosexual couples , or would they consider that the right of an adopted child to be placed in a heterosexual family environment is of paramount importance and , therefore , that adoptions by homosexual couples should not be considered desirable and should not be allowed by law in the eu ?
the european commission communication entitled 'early childhood education and care ' ( ecec ) is a welcome initiative , because it examines problems in children 's education and aims to establish means of providing children with the best start for the world of tomorrow .
you have understood this now to mean , in particular , the presence in the strasbourg court of a judge elected from each contracting party .
the decision taken by the european council last week to put in place a eur 50 billion fund to help member states outside the euro zone in this difficult period is a good thing , since what affects one of us affects us all .
it has taken seven years for the treaty of lisbon to finally take effect .
then , very quickly , the european commission - which i congratulate - adopted a proposal to establish the media mundus programme .
on the other hand , it is necessary to develop the european policy on migration and integration of migrants as a factor of european growth .
they were specialist officers from the spanish army , but they went there as simple soldiers as part of the international aid effort and were doing aid work when their helicopter crashed .
the ruling concerning the liga portuguesa confirms that the european union is regulated internally by 27 different rules , on the basis of which each state has decided to legislate .
in reality , the only thing that has moved swiftly in recent weeks , months and years is the market , which is frequently invoked in our regular debates here .
during a shootout at a supermarket in the town , two policemen who were in pursuit of the perpetrator were injured .
i would like to see the european parliament acknowledge that emissions of carbon black are contributing , to a large extent , to the warming of the arctic .
we are assessing what lessons we should learn from this for europe .
we also call on companies to apply family and women-friendly policies in their workforce management plans , which will work to everyone 's advantage : when everyone has that feel-good feeling , business runs better and this also benefits the women who work in it .
in order to achieve these objectives , which are facilitated by the treaty of lisbon , which introduces this competence over energy , which did not exist before , it is fundamental and essential to establish a strategic relationship with russia on energy and other matters .
new rules on the transport of people by bus should not adversely affect the freedom of lower-level authorities to organise their public transport themselves .
most of all , we wish you the love that you have spoken of .
that would be fundamentally at odds with the spirit of the european union , which was founded on the recognition of the equal dignity of members of the human family .
author . - ( fr ) madam president , the aim of this resolution is simple : it is to tell the truth .
we need to acknowledge and commend the efforts made by the european parliament to reach an agreement on this proposal at first reading and before the end of the current legislature .
it is good that the eu is based on the principle of solidarity .
resumption of the session
it appears that these costs are limited .
for the union , serious involvement in this region is linked to entry into the sphere of influence of russia , and this , surely , means the continuing use of half-measures in the region .
in 2005 she was awarded the robert schuman medal by the epp group in the european parliament .
he would admit a droit de regard in zones of influence for russia .
as regards the proposal for a single register , i do not think that there is any need for such a register with the commission since the european parliament and the commission operate in completely different ways and , consequently , have different relationships with lobbyists .
this was not present in the common position and was not supported by my group .
universal values should serve as a bridge between different religions and beliefs , and i do not accept the fact that universal values of human rights can be and should be subservient to either social or religious norms .
i thank him also for calling on member states , in his opening statement , rapidly to activate the child helplines , for the delays here are indeed unjustifiable .
i , too , have maintained on a number of occasions that they are vital and necessary components of the eu economic recovery strategy and the europe 2020 strategy .
i am pleased that members have taken a position in support of the ce mark as a major guarantee of compliance with eu standards and - most important of all - that they are in favour of strengthening its position .
if polish power stations are required to purchase all of their limits at auction from 2013 , electricity prices will increase by several dozen percentage points , and many sectors of the polish economy will therefore cease to be competitive .
in order to avoid any delay in the final adoption of this package , i believe we should take the opportunity to come back later this year when the rest of the financing of the recovery package has to be agreed .
you can see the mote in your brother 's eye but not the beam in your own .
money recovered from the beneficiaries in the years 2007-2009 represents only 10 % of total recoveries .
women and minors need improved protection .
we have to be able to do this , because while testing is vital and treatment is absolutely vital for those who have the disease , we also want to stop people getting aids , living with it and tragically dying from it .
it is time to move forward together on the subject of economic migration , because the european union must face up to the challenges common to all its member states ; challenges that require common solutions at the european level .
can i get assurances from you , commissioner , that the present public service obligation regime will not be impacted in any way by this future regulatory framework that you have in mind ?
the eu can not take responsibility for matters that are subject to national decisions or for any negligence that occurs .
air carriers should , in turn , give information as to their traffic forecasts , their intended fleet use and their present and future specific requirements at the airport , so as to allow the airport managing body to employ its capital and dedicate its capacity in an optimal manner .
at that point , i may need to come back to discuss this with you .
the fact that the regulation lists all the institutions - which means that discharge for the other institutions is just a matter of time - is an excellent result , as is the fact that it provides for a single auditor and accounting officer held in common by the two institutions .
madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the crisis has confronted us with the evidence that greater coordination at european level is an absolute priority for the development and stability of the financial markets .
the fact is that , by remaining committed to the globalisation of enterprises as an end in itself , the rapporteur continues to promote a system based on the absolute freedom of movement of goods , services , capital and labour , a system that has led us into a profound economic , financial and social crisis , a system with which the european union absolutely must break .
for parliament and the council to be compatible bodies , the council , too , should , to a great extent , work more openly , and that is exactly what is happening at the moment .
mr farage , it is the commission 's prerogative and you have had the chance to be heard .
however , we should be pragmatic as well as ambitious .
i will also give you an answer on kosovo .
( sv ) mr president , this is a huge change of topic but , if we do not resolve the crisis in georgia , we will need an even better asylum and refugee policy in europe .
however , we very much welcome the hungarian presidency 's focus on seeking a better solution regarding the integration of roma , and on the danube strategy .
in accordance with the authority given by the european council decisions of december 2007 , the slovenian presidency has started those preparations .
how did we respond to these aggressions ?
a few weeks ago my group organised a seminar at parliament in brussels , and i was very struck by certain of our visitors who were at the sharp end of such anti-competitive action , ironically in the cement industry .
the european union should put its trust in the poles concerned and not bow to pressure from lobby groups .
i advise people to be careful when voting , especially when it comes to candidates from poland , where neither the civic platform nor the law and justice parties know what all this is about .
the liberalisation of agriculture , in general , and of the dairy sector , in particular , has been a disaster .
i ask you to accept that there are deep-seated reasons for our differing positions , but also that this position is not irredeemable and that in conciliation , there will undoubtedly be formulas that we agree on , and that we will be able to accept a formula that everyone can understand that provides a solution not only for the countries that have vessels , but also those of us who suffer because we have coastlines .
the report highlights its provisional nature and that its extension must take place under stricter conditions and a level playing field must be re-established for the exit process in order to avoid any moral risks and , above all , so that the financial institutions that have not claimed state aid see their competitive position restored .
this is not a matter in which we should get involved .
this is an area in which it is very easy to agree on our goal .
in writing . - ( sk ) levels of consumer protection vary between the member states .
finally , a series of delegated acts is needed for the timber regulation .
i should like to emphasise that yet again .
in fact , the human rights situation has seriously deteriorated and we need to react to that .
thirdly , for 2011 , a mechanism for transferring part of the aid directed at supporting cereals towards livestock farming .
but for the last thirty years we have had mass unemployment and a sharply declining birth rate , which has taken us from baby boom to old folks boom and plunged the funding of our pensions into crisis .
today we have great pleasure in welcoming to our parliament a delegation from the parliament of the islamic republic of afghanistan .
we must urgently find means of fighting global warming .
the european union must not only ensure that an impact assessment is carried out in relation to these agreements ; it must also amend its legislation accordingly so as to promote sustainable production and sustainable economies .
the eib is a solid institution .
i am pleased we have highlighted the gender issue and asked member states to deal with the issue of men and women who take time off to care and that we have paid attention to the issue of mobility and the role of the eu 2020 strategy .
in europe , it should be a non-negotiable requirement that nobody can be detained for 18 months , especially when it is not because of something they have or have not done , but because authorities in their country of origin , through no fault of their own , are refusing to cooperate with the procedure for their deportation .
their effort has had its reward in the form of the agreement we finally reached in december .
it will fall to pieces ; of that there can be no doubt , as surely as it did for britain during the exchange rate mechanism in 1992 .
how do you want to get rid of this intolerable discrimination which derives from the fact that we hungarians , for instance , had to hand over our markets lock , stock and barrel to the european union , but we have received only a fraction of the subsidies ?
on behalf of the ind/dem group . - ( pl ) mr president , war is one thing , the destruction of nations and crimes against humanity quite another .
we have , for example , failed to ban advertising directed at children , a group which can not differentiate between advertising and facts , and any information presented to them in this way is therefore by definition misleading for precisely those consumers .
relations between the european union and russia following the assassination of journalist anna politkovskaya ( motions for resolution tabled )
it is a good thing that , however timidly , we are now attempting to deal with this problem .
unlike the national parliaments , we still do not have the possibility , in the budget procedure , to decide on the raising of our own financial resources .
explanations of vote
this initiative was introduced in the treaty establishing a constitution for europe and then in the treaty of lisbon , with the aim of granting citizens the same political initiative powers that the council of ministers and the european parliament already enjoy .
mother and father are the most important people for a child .
and so we get stuck in the apparent contradiction between the concern of the developed countries to defend their centres of excellence - meaning , in practice , their jobs - and cohesion policy treated as an exercise in charity .
at the same time , i consider it important to maintain the european social fund as part of the regulation on general provisions relating to financial resources within the framework of the cohesion policy .
it is likely that public sector support will be insufficient .
this is a huge sum , and the austerity package in greece is also huge ; yet we must not forget that greece has lived on credit for too long , with a retirement age of 53 years .
why are there so many problems ?
question time ( commission )
we wish you a pleasant stay and fruitful discussions with representatives of the european parliament , commission and council .
yes , mr obama is going to talk to iran and we must talk to everyone , including hamas , in the middle east .
you should either love your receiving country or get out .
the title of the motion for a resolution is 'natural disasters ' and it has been corrected .
despite the progress made , much still remains to be accomplished in serbia .
when the issue of co2 emissions is raised , it is unfortunate in my view that greater attention is not given to nuclear energy .
( sk ) mr president , the former yugoslav republic of macedonia has long been interested in joining the eu .
first and foremost , we must give vice-president tajani credit for having given a very strong boost to the new european tourism policy laid down by the treaty of lisbon , with the communication adopted last june and the associated implementation plan presented a few weeks ago .
mr schröder first signed an agreement with russia concerning construction of the nord stream gas pipeline , and then took a post on the company 's governing board .
our continent is truly indebted to haiti and has a duty to make amends for so many years of domination and plundering .
carbon capture & storage - davies report
the proposal for a regulation on energy statistics is part of the energy package adopted by the commission last year .
i firmly believe that such a rigid approach has no place , especially for small projects and projects financed from the european social fund .
as you can only go forwards , i ask that you justify the confidence we have placed in you .
i therefore believe that it would be wrong to think that the proper integration of the retail financial sector can be completed solely by means of self-regulation by the industry .
it is about time this issue was discussed in parliament .
i agree with the rapporteur that the agency must improve the quality of its procurement procedures in order to put an end to the shortcomings identified by the court of auditors .
it is essential to strengthen the framework of the economic and monetary union with the aim of securing macroeconomic stability and the sustainability of public finances .
the council is convinced that this is the only correct course in the context of globalisation , which includes many issues .
ordinary citizens must be guaranteed access to the social , educational , health and transport infrastructure .
companies taking on extra workers to fill the gap left by short working time raises unit costs .
these aspects are not , or are insufficiently , taken into account in the report .
further , i hope that this committee can have a specific role in the procedure which is under discussion for the citizens ' initiative .
you talk of acta and say that we need to adopt it , but you say that we should not use the means that would be effective in enforcing it .
there was a lot of rhetoric about human rights , just as there is now , but a huge gap between rhetoric and reality .
there is a shameful paradox here .
he forgets that french socialism gave europe françois mitterrand , he forgets that it gave us jacques delors ...
we are therefore absolutely dependent on the honey bee .
we need confidence to achieve this and the people of europe need perspectives .
that constitutional transition should be founded on substantive and consistent commitments which are properly followed through .
none of the large trading nations has yet resorted to across-the-board restrictions on trade and investment .
the markets are moving in another direction , and the eu does not go against market trends .
after several weeks of hearings with the new commissioners , this would not be an appropriate time to call into question the quality of a college of commissioners which has , over many hours in various committees , already provided very useful clarifications about the policies to be adopted .
finally , i would like to say that i believe that enlargement to the western balkans is too important for peace , freedom and prosperity on our own continent for us to jeopardise it .
we remember very well , mr president , that during the six years in which you worked with us , you attached very great importance to enlargement of the union to include the western balkans .
one thing that was missing - it is referred to in only one place - was the vision of the council and the commission in this respect .
thirdly , to environmental protection and the conservation of energy resources by reducing unladen journeys .
we all remember what happened at children 's homes in romania and guatemala recently - kidnappings of children for adoption are fresh in our memories .
it expresses a major responsibility and a strong commitment for this house and our communities .
meps have therefore called for universal access to affordable healthcare to be improved .
that is why i attach great importance to the key step we are taking today and will take with tomorrow 's vote ; of course , such complicated subjects as these , with complex transport systems and different regulation from one country to another , require an in-depth approach , as well as instances of compromise .
can the commission make a statement confirming that the proposed ccctb initiative will not impact upon the ability of member states to set their individual corporation tax rate ?
the draft regulation aims not only to allow vat to be calculated correctly , but also to monitor its correct application , particularly with regard to intra-community transactions , and combat vat fraud .

vice-president of the commission . - ( de ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , mr sacconi has certainly put me in a slightly awkward situation .
there are two major outstanding issues .
there is increasing despondency among researchers , research institutes , universities and businesses with the research framework programmes due to the complex nature of the european commission 's tendering procedure .
it should be remembered that poland requested assistance for 594 workers made redundant in three companies in the manufacture of machinery and equipment division in the nuts ii region of podkarpackie .
as the chairman of the committee on petitions , i notice how frequently the citizens of the european union are not aware of their rights and , conversely , how they sometimes believe that they can intervene in matters when they have no right to do so .
correction is going to be very painful , especially in the united states , but europe is not immune to economic downturn .
we must therefore supplement national labour law and the national systems , otherwise it will not function .
it is obvious from the debate and from some of the amendments that the european parliament also shares these aims .
and what a scandal this has been .
when applied in romania , it has been noted that a different approach needs to be adopted on the employment issue when the roma segment of the population is involved , as part of the measures implemented by posdru ( sectoral operational programme for the development of human resources ) .
the commission received 88 replies from interested parties , such as collecting societies , authors , creators and music users in member states .
we need to put pressure on our own member states to bring forward more aid , and more aid in kind .
in writing . - ( pt ) the current proposal forms part of a package ( along with the proposals for directives on interoperability and the european railway agency ) that seeks 'the facilitation of the free movement of locomotives across the eu ' , as part of the liberalisation of railway transport in the eu .
a journalist from the most influential newspaper in poland asked me , 'what do you people do in the european parliament ?
even so , it can provide a conceptual and legal framework for state intervention in production , and the social and ecological conditions under which it takes place .
welcome
it shames me to say that the author of too many of these regulations which hinder firms is brussels , which is contributing in this way to the further restriction of economic freedom .
however , we are joined together in a shared destiny by the euro .
the price of polluting our environment must be high , and the rewards for opting for carbon dioxide-free solutions must be tempting .
today 's debate was on a broader scale and it will help to propose a methodology .
the directive is right to stress the need to monitor contaminant emissions , which is of great significance in restricting contaminants , including those of cross-border origin .
cultural diversity is not just an ideal ; it is also a significant economic factor .
i can only assure you - and i think that you believe in my ability to find the right solutions at the right time - that this is going to be the way that we will manage the system under these circumstances .
it would not have been a very happy day to hold the elections to the european parliament .
salih mahmoud osman , you have our firm support and our warm acclaim .
the member states acted unilaterally in ordering and deploying vaccines .
we must not lag behind in this regard .
that can not be the solution .
i believe that we have taken a significant step forward in the process of democratising the european union .
this strength has been shown in the past when europe adopted the rules of the social market economy , which limits the damage done by an unprecedented crisis that is hitting every region in the world at the same time .
that is also the reason why the commission , in which commissioner liikaanen held the portfolio at that time , rightly recognised the need for a network-security agency .
the maturity profile of debt is left to member states , but the cumulative effect of tapping the market simultaneously leaves the eu exposed in times of crisis , leading to difficulties in raising capital in the markets .
today we are all invited .
the council has taken due note of the european parliament 's amendments adopted on 20 november concerning the modification of the rules for olaf investigations , and of the debates on this issue , which took place previously within the committee on budgetary control .
the main concept of respect for human rights must be complemented by a broader vision in which , as noted by the rapporteur mr scholz - whom i thank for the excellent work he has done in this report - various indicators are taken into consideration : post-conflict rehabilitation , the specific situation of women , trade unions , the situation of recovery after natural disasters , environmental sustainability and compliance with international social agreements .
all racs have submitted their opinions and , furthermore , as in any other legislation , we organised a public internet consultation .
however , in the reports which we presented before the plenary , we registered a complaint about the delay and the short time which the commission granted us to discuss these agreements .
everyone knows the facts all too well , so i will not dwell on that .
that is a great success .
we also have other plans to ensure that parliament remains open , since it is very important that it does .
detaining people for their ideals runs totally counter to the universal declaration on human rights .
since we had the original debates back in september , she has been to china .
in preparing its proposal the commission has considered that the appropriate legislative approach needs to balance the accuracy and complexity of the reporting method with the degree of variability in the ghg intensities of different fuels .
these small companies create the majority of jobs , and have the highest capacity to reinvent themselves and take the greatest role in innovation and preventing the european economy from falling even further behind .
the recommendation , by mrs garcía pérez , on behalf of the committee on regional development , on the proposal for a council regulation amending regulation ( ec ) no 1083/2006 on the european regional development fund , the european social fund and the cohesion fund concerning certain provisions relating to financial management ( 17575/2008 - c6-0027/2009 - 2008/0233 ( avc ) )
the report on the single market for businesses and growth is , in my opinion , very balanced , and i believe that the implementation of the proposed measures will stimulate the growth of the single market and , ultimately , the economies of the member states as well .
when we introduce emission cuts and targets for renewables our member states and their companies are put under pressure , and the temptation to create shortsighted , unsustainable solutions becomes overwhelming .
the reasons for the failure were many and i will come back to them in a moment .
let me begin by saying that i , too , disagree that implementation of the sixth community environment action programme is going according to plan .
certainly , today we can still give encouragement directly through your active presence in your member states and regions , which we have doing for the last year .
in my opinion , an important area in which women 's physical and mental integrity requires strong legal protection is in relation to genital mutilation .
therefore , cutting money for cohesion can not be an option in any way .
there are a lot of people in my country , which gets a new government tomorrow , who are interested in the question which i have put to commissioner rehn .
if we want farmers to stay in the countryside , we need to help them ;
just two more points , mrs staniszewska mentioned the importance of cultural action at regional and local level that is also emphasised in the report , but i think needs to be underscored .
we are becoming more and more dependent on gas from russia and oil from the middle east .
thank you very much for your point , which of course concerns us all on what is the day of european languages .
the european commission needs to remind the french government of its duties to be consistent and to respect the rules on implementation of european funding .
by voting for this package tomorrow , we are paying tribute to the victims of all the past or recent maritime tragedies and we are honouring citizens and businesses .
i am also delighted that the eu member states have given their general backing to the idea of visa liberalisation with the west balkan countries . i would like to express my wholehearted agreement here with the statement of mr rouček , who made a very powerful appeal in this regard , as the strengthening of personal contacts between citizens of west balkan countries and citizens of the eu is surely a positive step which will help to overcome the sense of isolation that some of these states feel and which will help create a europe without barriers .
furthermore , given the current uncertainty about the future of the european union after the outcome of the irish referendum , i think it would be appropriate to first analyse the causes and not to continue with the currency policy integration process as if nothing had happened .
i think that the slovenian presidency , which will be here today , will come back to this request .
i would also like this debate to be included in the discussions which we will now be holding .
he is asking for a change to the european ombudsman 's statute so that his work can become more effective .
this proposal would relax some restrictions , which have become unnecessary in light of the recent developments in vaccine production .
we will continue with that dialogue .
we must aim to do what is best for europe : free up the spectrum for new services and increased mobile traffic , open up new opportunities for culture and content , broadcasters and public services in the framework of broadband and , at the same time , secure the same opportunities for broadcasters as they enjoy today .
the eu 's measures are part of its anti-agricultural policy , which aims to reduce production and concentrate land in the hands of a few large-scale farmers .
this must be the first step .
i admit , being an old man , that i have seen many terrorist organisations during my time growing up from their beginnings , becoming more or less acceptable , and being accepted by the international community .
i would love to have an answer from the british government to that .
from the start , we have been very willing to compromise .
although this report does not overlook the serious problems and violations that continue to shake the world , it is not a litany of horrors either .
i would like especially to mention that we have to defend the human dimension .
the areas in question are belgian limburg , dutch limburg and the region of aachen .
our proposal for the establishment of a coordination system within and between member states therefore makes very good sense , simply because it guarantees efficient cooperation , particularly in combating terrorism and other forms of organised crime .
that point will be in the text of the european commission 's regulation .
the presidency should not suffer through this because i am certain that what i said here in my opening speech in the european parliament about how we would try to moderate the discussion and achieve a compromise is something that we have undoubtedly managed . the spring council provides proof of that .
the aim of the 'youth in action ' programme is to inspire a feeling of active european citizenship , solidarity and tolerance among europeans , from adolescence to adulthood .
it must promote more ambitious targets and demonstrate a stronger political will .
if the authorities in burma/myanmar again choose the road of repression , this will inevitably plunge the country into even greater international isolation , with further intolerable suffering for its people .
in writing . - i voted in favour of the resolution on russia .
i would like to stress that it is impossible to curb rising poverty in a year .
a visit by eu counter-terrorism coordinator gilles de kerchove , together with the commission , is scheduled for january next .
i shall end by informing you that , as of four to five days ago , close to 90 000 people had signed a petition addressed to the european parliament , the united states and world leaders , organised by the global internet movement avaaz .
opening of the sitting
( fr ) mr president , mr lópez garrido , mrs malmström , i wish to congratulate the authors of the motion for a resolution on the conclusion of the agreement between the united states and the european union on the transfer of financial data to combat terrorism .
author . - madam president , i will now repeat it correctly for the sake of mr romeva i rueda .
as someone with a deep interest in the former soviet republics in central asia , i see parallels between that region and belarus .
firstly , we must bear in mind that not only should association agreements between the eu and latin america be comprehensive , ambitious and balanced , but it is of paramount importance that they make a contribution to people 's human rights and social and economic rights , and to mutual sustainable development and to the reduction of inequalities .
the markets respond to the increase in demand on the part of more producers facing natural and environmental condition and react to financial speculation .
moreover , my country has set three priority areas for its presidency of the council .
the report calls on the general secretariat to continue implementing an integrated work-life strategy and to facilitate the career progress of women officials .
madam president , i would like also to thank the rapporteur .
i would like to draw attention to point 6 ; the application of the future instrument , once adopted , would have to be evaluated in order to assess its effectiveness .
let me begin .
not least , adequate knowledge of information and communication technology is just as necessary for the success of the directive ; moreover , it is crucial in strengthening the so-called field of e-health .
these people need to know that this parliament recognises their need .
we need to act now .
in a very brief supplementary question , what is the european union doing to confiscate the assets of terrorists within the union , and can the commissioner outline how many criminal assets bureaux are currently in operation in the european union ?
will carbon dioxide reduction goals come within that definition as clean air has heretofore ?
they are increasing their production in order to meet illicit trade demand and in order to increase their profits .
that would be a rewarding task for both sides and would help us in many ways .
mrs krehl , who is replacing mr kirilov , has the floor .
therefore , given the decision made by the only legitimate president , i hope that parliament , the institutions , the council and the commission will support his decision as the organization of american states is doing , as the united nations is doing and , by the way , as the united states is doing .
allow me to give a very clear example : eu aid to eritrea . in eritrea , critics of the regime are thrown into prison without trial and without even being told of what they are accused .
by the way , it was very interesting to hear earlier from the earl of dartmouth , speaking as he was as an aristocrat , about competition policy .
i will be thinking of all those who are being mistreated in tibet .
the first phase is complete .
however , this painful event has led to a climate of heightened emotion , hostile to this energy source .
mr schulz has challenged the ppe-de group to make this decision .
do tradition , history , intelligence and art count for nothing when , for millennia , they have characterised a people 's identity ?
from these we need to differentiate asylum seekers , those who infiltrate in connection with criminal activities , and those who may perhaps have been pushed into illegal action by the authorities themselves .
with regard to an allusion made by mr scholz to the guantánamo bay situation and the possibility of its territorial status being changed , this is an issue that arises from the international treaty of 1903 between the united states and cuba .
i am decidedly against the rapporteur 's approach , and also believe that to call for a change in the directive without the requisite analysis at member state level , particularly in those member states affected by the judgment of the european court of justice , is an unreasonable step taken for political ends .
i would simply like to point out that i think it is a great shame that members of the european parliament will be unable to attend the conference on 19-20 october because we will be here in strasbourg , and we can not be in brussels at the same time to take part in this important conference .
furthermore , it is even more remarkable that the court of auditors has pointed out that money has been used to pay private expenses .
it is important not only to improve the competitiveness and sustainability of the traditional sectors , but also to exploit the full potential of the atlantic area , with new markets , products and services , guided by two main priorities : protection of the environment and ecosystems , and job creation .
this is something that goes way beyond what the european union has been doing until now .
- ( cs ) as many previous speakers have already said , an effective fight against cancer must include the full spectrum of measures , from prevention to screening , including diagnostics , special treatments and palliative care .
that is quite right and proper .
the most important question , however , is what further measures europe plans in order to guarantee the safety of nuclear energy production .
in my view , nature needs to be protected , but through human action .
peace to you from god !
i think it is necessary to correlate the ten-t ( trans-european network of transport ) strategy , where the danube comes under point 18 , with the new territorial and economic development strategy , so that development takes place in a cohesive manner .
among other things , the court drew attention to carryovers and cancellations of significant budget appropriations : for example 38 % of the budget under the title 'buildings , equipment and miscellaneous operating expenditure ' was carried over to 2010 .
so far it is only talks that have resumed , and it is good that today 's debate has caused the commission to take proper note of what we think .
we must not change the directive .
so let us have a little bit of honesty in all of this particular debate and in all of these debates .
and what has happened as a result ?
it has been of great benefit to both businesses and european consumers .
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting : see minutes
it is not doing so , and nor is it demanding the abandonment of nuclear power , necessary though it is .
we know that for five weeks she was denied access to a lawyer .
an eu-china agreement on coordinated controls of trade in drug precursors is expected to be signed at the upcoming eu-china summit that will allow us to combat trade in illicit drugs more effectively .
this is why i think that one of the most important things which needs to be done is to increase the energy efficiency of buildings , and this should be accomplished by initiating work to renovate existing equipment and by installing a more efficient common infrastructure in buildings and heating systems .
therefore , if we are to proceed with iter , we will need to carry out reviews and more money will be needed .
and it is very cynical to portray the european financing of european election campaigns and all manner of european political foundations as a strengthening of european democracy .
however , i do also have to contradict you when you give the impression that there is no difference between information and advertising .
mr president , the eu can not be trusted .
secondly , i am delighted that we have together managed to grant european dairy farmers financial support .
it is becoming increasingly obvious , including in the light of the commission 's 2009 report on competition policy in europe , that competition policy is an essential tool that will help the european union to have a dynamic , efficient and innovative internal market and to be competitive on the global stage , as well as to overcome the financial crisis .
i would say to mr becsey that , in my view , the resolution on which we are going to vote in this house clearly underlines the issues involved in membership of the euro zone , as well as the importance of bringing the concept of solidarity to life within the european union , and that is one of the reasons why we strongly support this proposal .
commissioner , we have an opportunity in accra and we must do all we can to make sure that 20 % of aid is used for education , health , access to water and basic sanitation .
in essence , the mandatory mention of the energy label in advertisements will put an end to misinformation of end users , giving them all the information they need to make fully informed choices .
( fi ) madam president , commissioner , it has been said that private funding would also come from the united states of america and microsoft has been mentioned as an eit sponsor .
as mr krahmer said , it needs to be amended .
this is worrying european public opinion and is reflected in our relations .
on the other hand , we can not ignore the contribution which agriculture can make to cutting carbon dioxide emissions .
they too , by supplementing the monetary policies operated by the central bank , have to introduce sound policies capable of supporting price stability .
madam president , we propose very seriously to exacerbate it .
we look forward to working with ukraine 's new leadership to achieve our common goals .
there are countries where the subsidy is over eur 500 per hectare post 2013 , and there are countries - mainly the new member states - where it is less than even eur 100 .
if i am going to be here at 10 o'clock at night on a monday , tuesday , wednesday and thursday night , then we should at least be given a chance to speak on important issues relating to our member states .
all of the scientists , the researchers , there were female .
science can tell us in which direction fisheries should move in order to improve yields and decrease costs .
the council has also considerably developed its consultations with local and international non-governmental organisations , and today parliament has shown that it has a very important role to play in this evaluation .
we have nominated abbot malu malu for the sakharov prize , because this gentleman has , for a very long time , been committed to trying to find peaceful solutions in this region .
in the time available to me i would like to touch on another problem , which has its origins in the anti-nicotine policy pursued by a number of governments , namely the rise in smuggling of counterfeit tobacco products , their main attraction being that they are cheaper than the original product .
as a member of the european parliament 's delegation for relations with the people 's republic of china , i have noted with interest your response .
thus , this is a great opportunity for us and i hope , as has already been mentioned , that article ten will remain intact .
however , the amendments proposed by the rapporteur go some way towards reducing the level of overlap between this new proposal and existing legislation and this is to be welcomed .
the responsibility for managing the budget lies with the commission .
however , i think europe and our voters expect something more specific , and they expect the truth .
that is what the rapid alert system is all about , and in that respect it worked very well .
we have succeeded in reaching agreement in many areas - not least , the ambition to harvest the low-hanging fruit resulting from boosting energy efficiency .
hence our vote against .
we must rely , here too , on that solidarity , solidarity with the member states who might at one time or another have need of it .
so we should consider sanctions against syria .
we are convinced that the europe 2020 strategy will achieve gender integration to improve representation and equal participation in the labour market , breaking the pattern of segregation and ensuring the presence of women in jobs at a higher level .
faced with this situation , i welcome the involvement of the trade unions , yesterday in hungary , for example , or in brussels on 29 september .
( fr ) mr president , honourable member , i am not aware of any studies of the type you mentioned .
what can we do in this situation ?
i think that our efforts really brought us close to an agreement , and my fear is that this possibility will not arise .
it is also interesting that fairly lax rules on verification exist in the united states .
the elections are between the democratic and communist forces .
furthermore , we have to strengthen support to the poorest and most vulnerable countries to adapt to the increasing adverse effects of climate change .
on the carbon border tax mentioned during your hearing and now on the tobin tax , i bet you , mr de gucht , that before the end of your mandate , the commission will have to speak out strongly on the tobin tax because it is now an essential tool for regulating the financial markets .
i therefore voted in favour .
it is certainly true that member states were initially suspicious , given that the measure intended for adoption - the community 's acquisition of powers in the area of criminal law - will not be the fruit of a reform of the treaties but , instead , will be achieved through legislation which , in addition , is unquestionable and of immense significance .
in romania , only 30 % of the citizens know that this number can be called in case of emergency from any eu country and national authorities need to continue their efforts to promote this number in order to respond rapidly to problems related to climate change and other problems .
( applause )
i would personally like to stress certain points that my colleague , mrs vlasto , and i have been promoting within the committee on transport and tourism , which are that the european union needs to act to strengthen the competitiveness of the maritime transport sector , that this involves , in particular , improving working conditions and career opportunities within the sector , without dissociating the aim of competitiveness from those of sustainable development , fair competition and safety .
in 2005 alone an estimated 40 % of fish were caught without licence or in violation of regulations in the waters of guinea-bissau .
the european union has the potential to become the world leader in innovation and inventions .
the reinforcement of political ties and greater closeness to this giant must be regarded as strategic .
we have split the delegation in two so that one can concentrate on the issues , particularly of the world trade organisation , and the other can focus much more on the un agencies .
the objectives have also been agreed by member states themselves .
the effects of this are even more pernicious in the current period of economic and financial crisis .
yesterday , i voted against the report on the protein deficit in the eu because i believe that this problem can not be resolved by allowing genetically modified products to be imported into the eu .
i am very much in favour of a debate on energy efficiency based on a broad consensus at all political levels and involving all the relevant players and the creation of incentive systems .
as we have been saying , this situation is a result of the lisbon strategy 's objectives , and what objectives they were too !
dare i say that , in my opinion , making such mobilisation possible in that country is an achievement rather than a crime ?
finally , i would like to thank the european commission for its promptness in approving the funding for the four energy projects which romania is also involved in .
this report would provide the information needed to plan appropriate and preventive political interventions .
we hope its modalities can be announced as soon as possible , once the government of national unity has been shaped and starts its work .
let us not allow ourselves to be blinded by our ideological preferences .
this is at the root of the crisis , and when people talk about sustainable development , it is not just about a few piecemeal measures , it is about trying to explain and to understand that , while there are areas that need growth , that is , selective growth - renewables , and so on - there are a whole host of areas that need to be curbed .
however , the macedonians , the montenegrins and the serbs should be joined by the bosnians and herzegovinians , the albanians and the kosovars as early as possible in 2010 .
therefore , we have every reason to stay engaged .
go on josé saramango foundation !
however , we also need to tackle illegal immigration and the exploitation that often arises from this , particularly by furthering the proposal to penalise those who employ illegal workers .
but if that is what we intend to do , we must also put our own house in order .
as a part of the city , it has to be integrated into the sustainable planning of cities , in accordance with the main stated , proactive , objectives of the fight against climate change . as a part of regional development too , it must be optimised in view of the integrated approach in the leipzig charter .
would any board of directors approve the management of a company in such a state of affairs ?
national budgets designated to lifelong education vary from 40 % of the total amount used for education in northern countries to under 10 % in the new member states .
at a time of great economic difficulty such as we are experiencing now , the only purpose of this decision to strike at an economic sector that underpins our market is to make money , even if hardly any of this money is then used for transport infrastructure .
those expelled by the moroccan authorities included a member of this parliament , the president of the world federation of democratic youth , along with various journalists and members of non-governmental organisations .
the most important thing , however , is to protect the water from pollution , while the nuclear waste in the russian arctic is also a key issue .
it was on the basis of the commission 's proposals on energy and climate change , starting at hampton court in the autumn of 2005 , via the political agreement on the objectives in march 2007 and under the german presidency , and ending up with the legislative proposals in january 2008 , that the member states were able to reach a unanimous agreement .
innovation and financial markets must promote better consumer protection .
they will also permit an exchange of data elements , in real time , between customs authorities , in order to perform risk analysis and improve controls within the framework of common risk management .
we need a more flexible eu budget , where each year we can secure funding for essential needs .
i would therefore be grateful if the hungarian presidency kept up these efforts toward continued progress , whilst recognising that the council gives advice or makes recommendations on the discharge procedure , but it is parliament - the european union 's only democratic institution , directly elected by the european public - that decides and adopts the final decision .
my fellow conservative and liberal members , some of you want to punish automatically states that are heretics to your dogma to the tune of billions of euros .
we can hold an extraordinary summit every friday and release billions , but if we do not tackle the roots of the wrongdoing , one of these fridays , we will end up announcing that the eu is bankrupt .
this situation has been exacerbated by the crisis .
thirdly , i believe it is also essential and necessary to recall that all aid must be made available , whether political , financial or technical as may be required to perform the duties that that mission will have to face on the ground .
this directive , if adopted , will reduce the current fragmentation of the consumer acquis and ensure that all consumers in the eu will benefit from a single simple set of consumer rights , and this would make it easier to conduct pan-european education campaigns on consumer rights .
these challenges will be addressed by us under two initiatives .
membership of parliament : see minutes
we found that this problem affects companies transnationally , and that it has not only a strong financial impact , but also a serious psychological one on the victims of this sham , who are conned into signing this form and then later hounded by the company to follow up payment .
president-in-office of the council . - mr president , we move from one item to the next .
i am particularly delighted that the revision of the ombudsman 's statute , and specifically the strengthening of his powers of investigation , will help to ensure that citizens can have full confidence in his ability to conduct a thorough investigation of their complaints , without restrictions .
in writing . - ( sv ) the united nations millennium development goals report for 2008 says that the international community must continue to be prepared to take significant responsibility for the challenges facing humanity .
now , i would not dream of insinuating that this was because mr pöttering and mr schulz are buddies - alte kameraden as one might put it in german - but i do spot a recurring pattern here .
that makes people look to go abroad and they come here .
( sv ) mr president , i am extremely disappointed in the way that the hands of the main representative of the common foreign policy , baroness ashton , have been tied in the negotiations with regard to the crisis in the middle east .
however , any country whose energy supply is based on 90 % coal will find it more difficult to get down to 0 % .
i do not have the authority to modify comitology ; that is not within my powers .
i wish to emphasise the huge risks faced by young people drinking alcohol .
i am quite concerned for the future of a large number of european manufacturers .
( lt ) mr president , yes , the situation in pakistan is particularly complicated , both due to internal and external factors , and therefore , events like a political assassination for religious reasons , and of such an important figure , immediately rock the entire country and the whole of society .
the parties kept a few reservations , which still need to be addressed in the coming weeks .
with regard to the second part of ms trautmann 's speech , regional igfs have emerged in a number of places , and this appears to be a useful way to focus on questions of internet governance that are of particular importance for a specific region .
i think we in this house will have to get used to the enhanced cooperation procedure on measures which actually link employment and migration .
this is what is being prepared for in political terms in this report .
i would like to thank the commission for this initiative and i will not detain us any longer as time is limited .
the fact is that buildings account for around 40 % of energy consumption and around 36 % of greenhouse gas emissions in the eu .
member of the commission . - regarding the first question , i definitely belong to those who are not satisfied with the pace of our accession negotiations .
i will therefore listen to the concerns of those who know more about the wine sector , while realising that we do have to move this process on .
( de ) mr president , i should like to thank the president-in-office of the council , mr borloo .
in this area in particular there are many opportunities to save energy .
europe has urgent need of an authoritative leader , which this commission embodies completely .
however , we need common , effective and transparent action , and a common list of priorities for the benefit of our citizens .
on the contrary , the situation in camp ashraf is in the public domain and numerous people , including members of parliament and journalists , have visited the camp and drawn their own conclusions .
it is a year of transition to the treaty of lisbon and its ratification , with a view to its entry into force - which we would all like - in january 2009 .
the directive must specify the conditions of entry into the eu and any concrete rights , but it must not create a barrier to a situation where all legal migrant workers can enjoy fair and equal treatment , but , on the contrary , should secure and guarantee such treatment .
in austria , a purchase at a trade fair has up to now been treated , from a legal point of view , in the same way as a purchase in a shop .
only one country in europe has a definition of energy poverty .
an attempt has been made at a higher level to introduce comprehensive multinational regulations for foreign direct investment , or fdi , that would apply to all economic sectors .
we are now creating a market for the alternatives .
( ro ) madam president , the ceta agreement marks an extremely important step towards a fruitful future for both the european union and canada .
we therefore agree with the rapporteur that , in areas such as energy efficiency it is necessary to improve the statistics that we have .
the recurring crises have highlighted that the current situation , with russia as a single source and ukraine as the only transit country , does not provide any security for europe 's economy and citizens .
in fact , this programme is rooted in a policy .
asylum procedures must be fit for purpose and they must be implemented with great care .
( hu ) as regards the livelihood of banana producers in the eu and in acp countries , the council is aware that banana production is of fundamental social and economic importance to the banana-growing regions of the eu .
who in france would say , following the election of president sarkozy , that they should simply vote again because somebody does not like him .
the us is ahead of us , japan is ahead of us , and brazil , india and china are hot on our heels .
( lv ) thank you , mr president .
i have 17 people who have asked for the floor .
i strongly believe that it is the fishing nations themselves - those who have entitlement in particular sea areas - who should be making the decisions on stock conservation and management .
at the same time , however , we still condemn the fact political prisoners freed over the past years have not had their full rights restored , and one protesting student was unlawfully arrested during his pre-trial period .
however , it is an act of solidarity to help and support barack obama to return to the rule of international law when he asks us to do so .
i would therefore urge all members to support our amendment to article 8 ( 3 ) .
( it ) commissioner , before the end of next month , the european commission will formulate the proposal for the new multiannual financial framework for the period from 2014 to 2020 .
it is therefore of concern to us that the lisbon treaty , if it becomes law , appears to set in train a series of developments that could end up undermining that prerogative .
then they would no longer need to use manure , which we know that they need for cultivating crops , and they would no longer need to use black coal for heating .
where does this figure come from ?
with the increase over recent years in individualistic behaviour , the quest for new ways of individual expression , or even the changing demographic trends , civic participation has undergone major changes .
we have a conflict and that relates to the question of how much money there should be in the near future for meps ' assistants .
situation in thailand
there are also those who are destitute .
( de ) mr president , on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of economic and monetary union , there is really very little to celebrate .
this induces us to adopt the plan of action proposed by the presidency , namely that of drawing up a general approach , involving all the stakeholders on the internal market .
the rapporteur had tried to place the burden of the financial crisis with hedge funds and private equity , but these products are neither the origin nor the catalyst of the current crisis , and i congratulate the rapporteur on having recognised this and put it right .
in this regard , working with other members , a letter stating our case has been sent to commissioner potočnik .
the next objective will therefore be to make registration mandatory for all lobbyists .
for this reason , we must not treat this as sacrosanct but as something that we defend through joint efforts while adapting it to the 21st century .
people who are afflicted by hatred for homosexuals deserve no sympathy .
member of the commission . - volunteering in third sector activities plays an important role in eu policy making , given the benefits for society in terms of cohesion , inclusion , democracy , citizenship and also bringing us very clear , inherent , economic value .
indeed , the united nations special rapporteur has called agrofuels a 'crime against humanity ' .
( applause )
i also strongly believe that it is absolutely necessary to raise public awareness further in order to achieve a maximum absorption rate for the funds and the development of viable projects .
we in the pse group are not so much concerned with which document we do or do not support but believe the key issue really is whether these guidelines are an answer to the real economic situation , and the key issue is whether they offer any more help in tackling the needs of the people in the european union .
too often they have been regarded as a burden weighing down our economies , but they have done a great deal to keep the european model afloat .
the commission continues to be alarmed about the human rights situation in sri lanka , against a background of reports of extrajudicial killings , abductions and serious intimidation of the media .
in november in our resolution prior to the bali negotiations we in the european parliament stated that 'the european parliament recognises that intellectual property rights licensing fees in the area of clean technologies may constitute a barrier to the transfer of such technology to developing countries ' .
ministers , parliamentarians , journalists , lawyers , even human rights activists , who have always got involved before , no longer have the confidence to stand up against the challenge of these extremists .
for that reason , i fully support the present report .
mr president , i would just like to understand one thing : if only one or a few language versions are available , then i would like to know the language skills of the members of the commission and the council who signed the agreement and who decided on it on 30 november - so it must be available .
this state of affairs can not go on .
many of these measures are being adopted by individual countries .
despite the significant problems associated with storing hydrogen and putting it into a fuel tank , the ceaseless work being carried out by research centres all over the world indicates that this is the fuel of the future .
supporting a democratic egypt is incredibly important for us , and the economic challenges are massive .
mr president , as an mep elected in latvia , i welcome the fact that the first example of a strategy for a macroregion concerns the baltic sea area .
neither is it in the interests of the united states for the freely given commitment of many european countries to coalition to be usurped by a differently minded european union .
we went to one of the poorest communities and met pastoralist farmers there .
there are 30 million asthmatics in europe and we have a small manufacturer that has developed a device that makes inhalation - which can be a life-saver for asthmatics and is extremely important in their treatment - better , faster , more efficient and , above all , cheaper .
they are often local family enterprises .
i think that in this light we should consolidate this debate with a house vote .
one opinion poll does not announce confidence any more than one swallow makes a summer .
all that we have managed is to witness the development of the only country which promotes a despotic regime on a large scale , worthy of the dark middle ages .
this was in 2004 and 2005 .
i do not wish to run over time , nor do i wish my question to be debated and i thank the minister who was ready and waiting .
in general i think it is a positive step to simplify eu legislation , as it will improve access for citizens to that legislation and make it possible to work more efficiently in that field .
but i am also concerned about the hague convention .
on behalf of the alde group . - thank you mr president .
since up to 80 % of agri-food producers are small and medium-sized enterprises , it is also necessary to emphasise that the measures adopted must not burden them excessively .
in the interests of equal treatment , however , i would ask the commission to present a regulation ensuring transparency also in non-governmental organisations , for example .
perhaps a word of explanation is necessary concerning the correct actions of the president of the parliament .
lastly , the integration fund and the return fund can of course help member states to introduce pre-departure measures in third countries to assist potential emigrants in finding work in their country of destination , and facilitate their civic and cultural integration , or , on the reverse side , to introduce short-term support measures for returnees .
the aim of this directive is to strengthen the ability of individuals to defend themselves - that is the fundamental aim .
in this case , the council and , above all , this parliament are also involved in making the decision about the composition of the college and about the portfolios which you will make available and about the programme for the next five years that you will present .
there are no wordings in the report about the right to strike having to take precedence over the freedom of the market and of this needing to be written in to a socially binding protocol to the treaty of lisbon .
and more serious still , some have even been tried and convicted .
member of the commission . - ( fr ) madam president , ladies and gentlemen , with yesterday 's adoption by the united nations security council of resolution 1778/2007 on the deployment of an international force in the eastern part of chad and in the north-east of the central african republic the door is now open for the council of the european union to give its approval , within the next few days , to an esdp operation in these countries .
in writing . - i voted in favour of this report to stop misleading advertising by business directory companies such as the european city guide .
consequently , i wonder why alignment with the most protective rules is being rejected for these people in difficulty .
i can say that today in brussels , in the framework of the general first council at ministerial level , we had a good discussion on the eu-turkey relationship and the accession negotiations in terms of agreeing on the text of declarations .
we generally welcome ms grabowska 's report , which supports the proposal in its essential elements .
high-quality public finances and economic policies are , in fact , in the long run , more than ever necessary .
the best way of doing this , of course , is to reduce agricultural subsidies , which is eminently feasible now that prices are high .
the most glaring example of exploitation is romania , where the current government has decided that all pensions should be cut drastically and taxed , along with a levy for health care insurance .
in any case , you have said that there is no time to waste .
pressure on iran will be maintained , but it would be helpful to reach an agreement that would be workable for everyone and for regional stability , and to avoid any radical and often ineffective measures .
this article also applies to relations with cuba and with the cuban people , who are very dear to us .
discrimination in advertising runs counter to the aim of equality .
mr president , commissioner , the report i am presenting to parliament sets out to explain that the agricultural sector has a place and a role to play in the fight against global warming .
leaving aside the dubious reference to data on world population growth , which does not reflect the recent reduction in birth rates in various non-european countries , food security is undoubtedly linked to good use of agriculture .
it is contrary to human nature , which logically should shine forth in a democracy , however inconvenient .
this is of particular importance as the european elections approach , and i hope we can count on you to keep this matter high on the agenda .
in poland , there is a saying that the woman holds up three corners of the house , and the man only one .
these ngos are a strange disease affecting our democracy . although unelected and unauthorised , they are allowed to draw money from our funds since they act for the greater good , of course .
why is it filtered by the ministry of the interior ?
products are developed with deliberate weak points which shorten their useful life and increase consumption , such as laptops and smart phones .
we will not manage this by the end of the year , partly because we need the treaty of lisbon to enter into force first .
as a hungarian mep , i can not but support these efforts because they will make it possible for hungarians living in vojvodina in serbia , for example , to establish a more direct link with the mother country .
its leaders must assume their full responsibilities regarding the country 's development and must ensure in this way that the stabilisation of the entire region is consolidated .
i do not really understand why you said you were opposed to amendment 4 , but perhaps we can talk about that again later .
the european union is now facing very serious problems , such as the financial crisis and the energy crisis caused by the ukrainian-russian conflict .
two different attitudes can be adopted with regard to the current situation : either people settle for marching in the streets and striking - that is part of the trade union movement ( i myself was a trade unionist ) - or , after having expressed their concern , they set about redressing the situation on the basis of a fair policy .
( pl ) madam president , the current need of eu legislation is for it to be simplified so that the law is clear and comprehensible to every citizen .
moldova is currently facing serious economic and social problems , and the european union must demonstrate that this symbolic word of 'solidarity ' does not only apply during election campaigns .
the opening up of strategic sectors and the assignment of essential public assets to private initiative is another characteristic of the european union .
the high-level group is meeting and its members are , as i understand it , high-calibre individuals : it is not just producers who are represented , but distributors too .
this has happened everywhere that the expression 'people 's power ' has been used .
if eib loans went towards new energy and environmental technology , that would meet the world 's real needs at the present time more successfully .
we should really also be considering here whether this will improve security in europe and europe 's defence , or whether it will go the other way , with the new system actually weakening security in europe .
now there are amendments tabled by you , mr stevenson , one of them jointly with mrs mcguinness , which propose that the system be made voluntary .
organisation of working time ( debate )
in recent years , ukraine has turned into a political football pitch with a struggle between russia and the west for influence during the orange revolution and the last elections .
therefore we have chosen to abstain .
well i am not fooled , and many of my colleagues are not fooled either .
it is therefore regrettable , and we trust that we will be able to achieve this in future legislation .
that area is no longer restricted to five member states , as it was in the 1980s .
in the case of ukraine , this process should end with the prospect of full membership of the european union , of course , following fulfilment of the copenhagen criteria , and for this , it is essential for there to be greater political commitment from the authorities in kiev .
we must identify the names of the responsible un commanders .
member of the commission . - i am very happy to have received this question , because i have good news to report .
unfortunately , in my own constituency , the minister of the environment , sammy wilson , is one of these short-sighted politicians who does not understand the scientific and practical realities of climate change .
with the agency proposed by the rapporteur , however , there is an urgent need for the introduction of clear principles for the democratic monitoring of europol and personal data protection .
consequently , i think that you will need to monitor the process very carefully .
you were unable to genuinely balance the way these were distributed .
nevertheless , the reality is that a growing share of the wealth generated in portugal is being transferred abroad .
i would also like to thank the rapporteur , dan jørgensen .
i should stress that monitoring the proper implementation of this regulation is the responsibility of the european commission , which may adopt appropriate measures .
the buildings sector in the european union is one of the sectors with the most opportunities for energy saving .
i mean to say that we all need the courage to change . stefan george , the great german writer , says that the future belongs to those who are capable of change .
now to the last item : the international arms trade agreement .
colleagues , please keep to the allotted time .
there are some proposals , which have already largely been adopted at european level , on the indecent remunerations in the sector , where we could do considerably better .
i want to know what action the commission will take , and what action it is initiating , to try and get compliance .
i believed him .
i therefore think it is important to point out that the direct reference to the weapons industry in this regard is often misleading .
freedom of the press is essential in a democratic society .
it was also important that we settled on a deadline , i.e . copenhagen 2009 .
if there is a request for a referral because there is no quorum , the point is not carried forward , it is annulled .
at the same time , i support the collective approach to looking for solutions , including compiling an aid package for greece , tightening the regulations concerning the single currency and carrying out stricter supervision .
it must be one of the major priorities , because this has not been the case during the last five years .
this also applies to the 1.5-2 million hungarians in transylvania .
this verdict is the last of six rulings by the high court and the court of appeal in britain , as well as the cfi , in favour of the pmoi , all of which emphasise that the pmoi is not involved in terrorism and does not plan to engage in terrorism .
the european union must size up the situation and support the democratic process without prevaricating .
( hu ) as was the case in the previous major debate of this week here in the european parliament , namely , the debate on poverty , the politicians of the european union are once again surprised and sad to see that the situation of europe 's citizens is not improving , but rather constantly deteriorating .
certainly , i very much respect the united kingdom as a democracy and a country of the rule of law .
this directive will not have achieved its objective and will not be effective if the energy label can not be easily recognised and compared by the consumers at whom it is primarily directed , in order to help them make the best possible choices .
secondly , qimonda has no competitors in europe but does have some in asia , where they are assisted by 70 % subsidies - that makes the crucial difference .
the ball is now in parliament 's court , and parliament does not have to start from scratch .
an agreement was not reached between the parties during the trialogue .
in finland peat has been defined as slowly renewing biomass fuel .
some demonstrators have been sentenced in mass trials which took place late at night and while people did not have access to a lawyer .
had i written the report as it stands today , what would i have had to offer in the compromise negotiations ?
i believe that through slovenia , the european union will speak in a voice more understandable for many of the western balkan nations .
in the second amendment that i tabled , i wanted to ensure that the prospectus requirement remained in place in the case of staff placements .
it is not just a matter of inequality between countries .
i wonder whether it is the eu 's weakness or indifference that prevents it from promoting the observance of human rights in this area more consistently .
the budget will have to be accurately balanced to ensure the successful realisation of the goals set out in the treaty of lisbon , like the creation of a common internal energy market for example .
( fr ) mr president , as i indicated during the debate , i propose adding the following oral amendment to paragraph 6 : 'calls on the nigerian authorities to reverse the recent move by some nigerian state governors to execute death-row inmates to ease overcrowding in prisons , which would constitute a gross violation of human rights ; calls on the state governors to exercise restraint and continue the de facto moratorium ; recalls that the use of the death penalty is contrary to nigeria 's commitments at international level ' .
if you look back over the history of the cooperation in judicial matters and police matters that we have instigated here within this parliament , 90 % of it has been predicated on the basis of mutual trust between the different authorities at member state level .
it is unacceptable , however , that the rapporteur expressly anticipates the entry into force of the treaty of lisbon , when it has become clear that the majority of citizens want nothing to do with the european constitution or a carbon copy of it .
with over 900 now dead , the futility of politics-by-war is painfully evident .
this is indeed a desirable development .
the results were made available in october 2008 .
i believe that mr almunia is well aware of all the problems we are experiencing with different databases , their use , security and the possibility of their being used for the wrong purpose .
i give a personal commitment to you to ensure that the european parliament 's concern will be addressed and that we shall seek a strong protection of privacy and data protection in the new agreement .
when more than one third of the investigations carried out by the ombudsman involved cases where there was a lack of transparency and when 56 % of all cases were resolved amicably , it only serves to confirm how important the office of the ombudsman is .
domestic work , often insecure , undervalued and undeclared , represents 5 % to 9 % of total employment in industrialised countries .
the european union needs to take a clear stance and have plans than can be brought in to combat the economic crisis .
it is also essential to provide natura 2000 with the financial means for its management and the effective pursuit of its objectives , bearing in mind that many forest areas are covered by it .
this phrase encapsulates the hope that people can learn from history .
the european parliament must take the lead in defending ethnic minorities , by initiating a serious debate on the legal status of minorities .
we need to revalue the predominantly female health sector by increasing wages and improving conditions , as well as the availability of the services , as it is an increasingly important sector for our ageing society .
uk roads have high safety standards - for instance , too many speed cameras .
i would urge you to find a solution .
you can look around - one third of 785 is a little over 200 , and there are about 30 of us here .
such a situation is light years removed from a return to the status quo of 7 august , which is a condition for attending talks with russia .
this may entail enormous innovation and a worldwide marketing strategy for the entire river region .
they expect food coming into the european union to be produced according to the same high standards as food produced internally .
my first question is : are they also in our field of vision ?
i am less proud that next to nothing has happened in this area since then .
steel is another story .
one thing is clear : all put acp development at the centre of epas .
in addition , the report points out that recent events involving russia 's attack on georgia 's territorial integrity endanger the relationship between the european union and russia , as does russia 's part in the gas supply crisis .
more than 100 million people in 70 plus countries received aid amounting to nearly eur 1 billion from the european union in 2009 .
( de ) madam president , commissioners , the euro is our shield and it has proven to be a stabilising force .
secondly , the time horizon for a future work programme - here mr verheugen wants to set a very long-term perspective , but this has to be weighed against the mandate of this commission and we need to have some short-term results .
the code of practice which we are voting on requires that young people should be guaranteed safe access to the internet .
the single currency is part of the problem , not part of the solution .
it would actually have been better if we had not taken this problem to the court of justice , but had opened up negotiations with the commissioner , with the president of the council and with parliament in order to find a political solution to this problem .
the european commission 's initial proposal for a directive on information to the general public on medicinal products subject to medical prescription has thrown the doors open for pharmaceutical companies to advertise their drugs .
mr president , cultural heritage is crucial to preserving identity .
let us hope therefore that it will be the symbol of 2008 !
i am going to focus my comments on a paragraph in the haug report that points out the lack of correlation between requirements for fighting climate change and the eu budget .
these municipalities , numbering 39 in total , are on the periphery , and the river danube still represents for them an insurmountable barrier rather than an opportunity .
iraq today has a true parliament and a wholly secular constitution .
i was able to follow the end of a pilot project last week , but as a result , there was not time to put the experiences gained from it in this report .
i am very honoured to be leading parliament 's delegation to the human rights council 's 16th session at this critical time next week .
( pl ) mr president , i just wanted to point out that , amongst renewable sources of energy , we have not paid much attention to geothermal sources , that is to say , to clean energy .
moreover , we also welcome the creation of the system of the universal periodic review which , as of next year , will also allow for a regular thorough examination of the human rights records of every un member state .
madam president , for a start , i pay tribute to my colleague who has just spoken for her tireless work on human rights .
today , almost on the eve of that occasion , we are debating the third rail package , which is also and from my point of view very specifically concerned with the rights and obligations of rail passengers .
the commission has thus put an end to this illegal situation , and i thank them for it .
i believe that , during this next period , the authorities in the former yugoslav republic of macedonia must focus particular attention on implementing the norms which have been adopted .
the commission will put together a set of indicators identifying the areas in which the risk of failure to meet tax obligations is greatest .
the joint debate is closed .
in order to guarantee sustainable development in europe - and i would emphasise the word sustainable - the eu must earmark more funding for the development of innovation and research projects in the new eu member states , under the heading of sustainable development .
we need it as soon as possible .
these statements included an appeal from italian mayors and from the italian minister of the interior to me , because at that time no one thought that europe had any tools like those subsequently adopted with the decree-law to tackle situations where there was a clear violation of directive 2004/38/ec .
this is the latest episode in a chain of serious violations of human rights which have entailed the repression of political opponents , homosexuals , journalists , intellectuals and anyone who is fighting for the social and civil development of iran .
( hu ) i have only one question . poverty affects two social groups most particularly : the low-skilled and those living with disabilities .
moreover as an organisation that has been unable to get its own accounts signed off for thirteen years the eu commission can not be considered to have any expertise whatsoever on finance or to be a fit body to put forward legislation on control of the financial system .
olaf 's activities should be supported ; we ask for statistics and reasons in cases where national authorities did not file indictments following reports by olaf , which happens in 73 % of the cases initiated by olaf .
i stress the necessity that european funding be addressed directly to the beneficiary iraqi institutions .
such an approach is in accord with the resolution adopted two years ago by the european parliament on the ecological hazard to the baltic in relation to the nord stream project .
there has not just been consultation with parliament , its members and its committees responsible for car-related issues , competition amongst dealers and consumers , but also consultation with the member states and consultation with all stakeholders and anyone else who has wished to express their opinion .
it is important that we are debating it here in parliament .
i voted in favour of this document , codifying council regulation ( ec ) no 975/98 of 3 may 1998 on denominations and technical specifications of euro coins intended for circulation .
now he is comparing the campaign in ireland with the brutality of the latest elections in zimbabwe .
it is regrettable that some seek to bring sexual and reproductive health down to just abortion .
however , i believe that this tax should be established globally and not only in europe , in order to avoid creating a competitive disadvantage to europe itself which , let us not forget , is highly attractive being the largest global market .
when you think that a head of state of the only remaining superpower in the world recently threatened a possible third world war , that strikes fear right to my heart .
imprisonment is not meant to cause harm to those sentenced , let alone to members of their families .
this market test , or impact analysis , is indeed already being applied to some extent , by the broadcasters themselves , among others , but not according to the modalities as these have been set out in the commission proposal , which look somewhat different .

we call on the ministers to adopt a road map for implementing the euromed free trade area at the forthcoming conference .
finally , we stand ready to develop the full range of our enp and eastern partnership offer for belarus .
we are currently in the third phase .
the correct design and construction of this machinery play a significant role in reducing the adverse impact of pesticides on human health and the environment .
a further and highly significant element in the area of human rights is the need to sharpen up the instrument that governs the finding and distribution of financial aid to the opposition in countries with an inadequate level of democracy .
i also urge you to link in some of the objectives of our europe 2020 strategy : employability , employment , the fight against poverty , and research and development .
i do not want to mention the consequences for the world climate if we carry on as before and have no proper rules .
during recent years , it has become clear that a large proportion of the projects carried out in agricultural areas would have been inconceivable without the active involvement of women .
i believe that the situation would have been much worse without aid from the eu and other countries .
i wonder if the committee of investigation which has been set up in ramallah is in a position to carry out a thorough investigation in gaza at all .

under the specific programme on 'capacities ' , the research potential of the eu 's convergence and outermost regions must be unlocked .
i think we can all recognise the fruits of our cooperation in the compromise amendments that will be tabled for the vote tomorrow .
however , we are not happy with the compromise which has emerged and therefore voted against paragraph 2 in amendment 77 which concerns consumer contracts .
furthermore , this agreement seriously harms a sector that provides countless jobs not only in our acp partner countries but also in the outermost regions ( ors ) .
therefore , it is essential that we clarify the interest rate scenario and ask for caution in interest rate rises in europe , in order to strengthen the economic growth and job creation that we need so much at this stage of eu integration .
i asked him : 'mr djukanović , why , when we are discussing what happened in ireland - no to europe , no to the treaty of lisbon - are you so keen to join the european union , to be part of the european union , when you have been independent for such a short time ? '
on behalf of the alde group . - mr president , no one will disagree that terrorism needs to be prevented and that suspects need to be tried and held accountable , brought to justice in a fair trial , but in the so-called war on terror , we risk compromising precisely those freedoms and values that we claim to defend against destruction through terrorism .
the manufacturers have made great technological progress over recent years .
we find ourselves in a situation where the minimum wage , which is a national competence , in reality is discouraging competition .
the eib is currently under-staffed , despite its impact on so-called developing countries .

i consider the adoption of this report emphasising the agricultural sector to be extremely important .
( the speaker agreed to take a blue card question under rule 149 ( 8 ) )

we want to eradicate youth unemployment .
mr president , i think that the diagnosis as designed and the therapy as planned are correct .
commissioner , i should like you to answer that question .
i should remind you that mr barroso is the president of the commission , not of the european parliament .
the commission proposals have ridden roughshod over labour law and called into question something which would generally have been regarded as a legal minimum standard .

a threshold value - as is already the case for the adventitious presence of traces of authorised gmos for the labelling of products as gmo-free - should be applied for the adventitious presence of traces of unauthorised gmos that have already obtained a positive assessment from the efsa or that have undergone a feed and food safety risk assessment in accordance with the codex gm plant guidelines .
some norms concerning the financial markets that have a direct and indirect application to hedge funds and private equity do exist above the national and european level .

with these two comments , which i am sure will be taken in the spirit in which they are intended , i would just like to say that i wish the rapporteur every success and thank her again for this report .
i wonder , however , whether this attitude is a digression , or conversely whether it is the start of real european economic governance , because what we do not need , ladies and gentlemen , is governance .
i also support the rapporteur 's proposal for the process to be completed by 1 may 2014 .
the report also highlights the massive disparity in average occupational pension between men and women .
discussions are taking place within the framework of un decisions .
some banks engage in financial speculation , but fortunately , we still have a banking network where the manager knows the businessman who goes to ask for credit , and so he can trust him , and also knows that the money he invests will be reinvested in the bank , and that what happened in the united states will not happen here .
do you agree that the liberalised market is unable to self-regulate ?
