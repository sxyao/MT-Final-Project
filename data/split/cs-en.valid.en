with regard to aid and the european union increasing its level of financial support for humanitarian programmes in kenya , i would be interested to hear commissioner michel 's answer on how exactly that money will be spent and to make sure it has been spent correctly , as raised by previous speakers .
when my country , portugal , was receiving a visit from high chinese dignitaries recently , the government steered a demonstration by amnesty international away from the place that the entourage was going to pass through to somewhere a few hundred metres away ; the same thing happened in france , where a demonstration was moved to the eiffel tower .
the truth is that the situation in spain will count for more within the value judgment that will be made of this presidency than what was done or not done here .
not by the germans , they say .
that level of joined up and targeted thinking can only bring greater rewards .
you just carry on with the projects and to hell with anyone who might not agree or have a different point of view .
member of the commission . - ( el ) madam president , i would also like to thank the members of the european parliament that took part in today 's debate for their constructive opinions .
i can see commissioner mccreevy sitting there .
( pl ) mr president , commissioner , mr berlato 's report deals with a combination of health and agricultural issues .
for investment agreements to further benefit these countries , they should also be based on investor obligations in terms of compliance with human rights and anti-corruption standards as part of a broader partnership between the eu and developing countries for the purpose of reducing poverty .
mr president , i would like to thank you and all those members who took part in this debate regarding a temporary measure - and i would emphasise that temporary nature - in the field of air transport .
finally , because time is so short , you spoke about the fifth freedom - the freedom of the movement of knowledge .
this cultural heritage should be managed in a sustainable manner .
it rests with the political authorities and the administrative and regulatory authorities to play their part in permitting and enthusiastically encouraging continuing improvement .
there is no difference between the two resolutions in relation to our calls for free and fair elections , but they do differ in their assessments of the government and the majority party in moldova .
on behalf of the pse group . - ( de ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the portuguese presidency has been a success and i congratulate you , mr sócrates , and your entire government , on this success .
that is why the report gives attention to the importance of monitoring human resources .
( es ) mr president , yesterday our group held an alternative energy summit in which we demanded binding 20 % energy efficiency and 30 % renewable energy by 2020 .
written explanations of vote
now to specific issues raised in the green paper .
this is the added value which the european commission can provide at the present time .
our package will set out a general framework , which would then be completed in the course of this mandate by other instruments focusing on the specific needs of certain types of victims .
i should therefore like to welcome the recent proposals tabled by the commission regarding the creation of a european disaster response that includes establishing a voluntary pool of member states ' emergency organisations and developing contingency plans , as well as the merging of humanitarian aid crisis centres with civil protection to form a european emergency response centre , responsible for monitoring dangerous situations , issuing early warnings and coordinating eu disaster response .
it seems that in europe today - just as george orwell wrote years ago - some pigs are more equal than others .
here i also would like to thank the european parliament , and especially the committee on culture and education , for its support .
( nl ) mr president , last september , parliament refused to close the accounts of the european police college because of serious mismanagement and structural problems .
the consequences of the communist regime 's crimes are a repulsive scar on the face of europe .
we still do not know if the crisis will act to deepen the differences between different regions of europe .
that will be a unique opportunity to pass on our message .
it is time for action .
my abstention in the vote on the report regarding the agreement between the european union and the federative republic of brazil on air services expresses a position that goes beyond the scope of the matter .
it is not an option , it is mandatory .
instead we must continue to progress along the trail of liberalisation that the eu is currently blazing by adopting measures such as this .
to close , i should like to wish the new commissioner every success in his job and , if i may , say the following : our honourable and experienced colleague , mr cercas , said earlier that he hopes that you will enter and proceed with the 'right ' foot .
on behalf of the ind/dem group . - ( nl ) mr president , this house champions civil liberties , one of which is freedom of education .
i voted in favour of this report , because bluetongue is a disease affecting ruminants ( such as cattle , sheep and goats ) .
the uk government has vowed to end this obscenity - but to date they have fallen short .
i feel that the european public wants it .
the convention on cluster munitions prohibits the use , production , stockpiling and transfer of cluster munitions .
i am just preparing an e-mail to all members , which i will sign in person .
thirdly , a model of evolving action has been developed - according to the weather forecast , the evolution and activity of the volcano can change from hour to hour - but who is going to continue to carry out an up-to-date assessment of the safety of air corridors ?
at the same time , the eeas requires an organisational unit which will be responsible for gender issues , with at least one full-time post in each geographical department and eu delegation devoted to gender aspects , with responsibility for women , peace and security .
vice-president of the commission . - ( it ) madam president , mrs lichtenberger , i shall reply to you in italian because i know that you are a scholar of my mother tongue .
mr schulz , i have been informed that this motion was tabled an hour earlier , from which i conclude that it was done as a preventive measure .
it is clear , however , that the number of applications to register under the protected geographical indication ( pgi ) , protected designation of origin ( pdo ) and traditional specialities guaranteed ( tsg ) quality food schemes varies considerably from one member state to another .
this was the reality before the current block exemption was adopted in 2002 , and it remains the reality eight years later , but then , as now , single branding was the most common distribution model .
i therefore consider the new budget to be excellent .
i am convinced that the role of the european central bank and of the governments of individual eu member states will be crucial in this process .
to a certain extent we are repeating what we said then , but we are also saying some things that are rather stronger and , as mrs doyle said , they come at a critical moment when most of us in this house would want to see the eu take up a seat on the arctic council , and we would not wish to compromise that .
for example , as commissioner michel was telling me , the report notes that in 2007 the amount of aid given by the 27 did not increase as it should have done , but actually fell .
in writing . - ( sv ) we have chosen to vote against the two partnership agreements on fishing between the eu and guinea-bissau and côte d'ivoire , respectively .
that is already a first victory ; in any event , it represents a real break from the culture of secrecy that has characterised this sector for more than forty years now .
they are almost incomparable .
the internal market forum and the joint debate on these three reports on the same day every year will give us the opportunity to ask ourselves all these questions and to make the internal market into a domestic market for all citizens .
i call upon all parties to rapidly come together right now over this and , once and for all , bridge this unfair digital divide .
we have a shortage of employers - not a shortage of employees , but of employers , who can provide people with work .
never have eu funds been utilised more efficiently , never have we brought more small and medium-sized enterprises into international networks , and never have the regions been better prepared to utilise the european programmes .
the reports must be submitted quickly , but they must be thorough , and thoroughness is more important than speed .
i hope it will not happen like that .
trying to achieve both in equilibrium will be the content of those negotiations .
( pt ) i would stress that it is with great satisfaction - shall we say - that the group of the european people 's party ( christian democrats ) and its portuguese members are seeing the start of europe 's process of accession to the european convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms .
( fr ) mr president , i will be very brief .
we must make sure that we do not create a new divide , where the poor people outside the roma communities are critical of the fact that the roma are suddenly receiving large amounts of money or a great deal of attention .
at wednesday 's sitting , the european parliament adopted the giannakou report on the status and rules regarding the funding of political parties at european level .
that is really important to us in the group of the progressive alliance of socialists and democrats in the european parliament .
opening of the sitting
the fight against poverty is a struggle to improve the run-down districts found in all the major european cities .
this project has the potential for serious disruption to the vulnerable ecosystem of the baltic sea , but the most serious threat to the project is the lack of trust between russia and the countries around the baltic .
do our european policies on transport , the environment and regional development really take account of one another ?
i support the initiative by the socialist group president , mr schulz , who sought to use this revision to prevent the french leader of an extreme-right party from having the honour of chairing the inaugural session of the new parliament .
we support some parts , mr saryusz-wolski , but not other parts !
also , primarily , how do we ensure that africa can benefit from its own raw materials in the long term , too ?
this would appear to suit both sides : the eu member states , which are looking for other energy supply sources , and the countries of central asia , which would like to sell their raw materials at higher prices .
the action plan will also assist policy makers at local , regional and national level , in full respect - i repeat , full respect - of the principle of subsidiarity .
in fact , in its opinion , efsa has indicated that amt could be considered as a useful tool to complement the hygiene practices already implemented in the european union .
it has exploited every single line of defence and has shown no inclination to take part in constructive cooperation .
overall , i should like to say that , whilst the european union naturally advocates free trade , this resolution should not result in us calling for anti-american rhetoric .
finally , i want to highlight one point that was made clear by mr poignant and i thank him for highlighting the importance of jean monnet .
i am afraid that the mining machinery industry will follow mining production and move out of europe .
that brings me back to the beginning of our afternoon .
therefore , i believe that at this time it makes more sense to optimise the programmes and projects which we have in such a way that they serve to finance the small business act .
for this very reason it is crucial that the world bank adopt a new strategy for financing energy projects , committing to providing efficient , accessible and clean energy as a means of reducing poverty and fostering economic growth .
we envisage creating , in 2008 , a european network of associations of victims of terrorism , in order to represent victims ' interests at european level and to strengthen european citizens ' solidarity with victims of terrorism .
the report under discussion aims to achieve necessary balance between a high level of consumer protection and the competitiveness of companies in the insurance market , while at the same time respecting the principle of subsidiarity .
there is also a need to see a more balanced road sector that is not only economically sustainable , but also environmentally sustainable , and one that recognises that it has to pay a fair price for the costs it creates - be these environmental or infrastructure costs .
i have to say that i simply do not understand that remark .
mr schulz , i am not certain we can discuss this point again .
it should be emphasised that both the commission 's strategy and parliament 's report reflect the spirit of the treaty of lisbon - what it says about energy solidarity and its concern for energy security and supply .
with public procurement , to encourage the replacement of old vehicle fleets with new vehicles , is to put the economy at the service of the environment ; to reduce co2 emissions in order to create demand is to put the environment at the service of the economy .
we plan to launch the eastern partnership at summit level in prague in may and the decision of the day was also selected just when this six-month period ends and we can make an evaluation .
only those who are tolerated by the regime can take part .
we have a number of straits , including the bosphorus , gibraltar and pas-de-calais - through which 800 commercial ships pass every day - which are among the largest ports on the planet .
the 'cleansing ' of other ethnic , national and social groups during world war ii should also be remembered and commemorated .
if we consider the consequences of global warming , it is obvious that the developing world is paying the price for environmental damage caused by the richer nations .
first , the excessive requirements for third country citizens taking up employment here .
the proposal would slowly kill off small and medium-sized livestock enterprises , which are struggling to survive , particularly as a result of the steep increases in feed prices .
we also asked the commission to tackle this problem at the time of the negotiations on the free trade agreement and we invited the indian government to do its utmost to eradicate the deep causes of this phenomenon and to put an end to it .
we have applied sanctions on belarus , but we have not done so with regard to the magnitski case in russia , although this had been pointed out by the european parliament in the annual report on human rights in the world 2009 and in the european union 's policy on the matter .
on the one hand , it maintains that proof of origin is useless , since it states that the european union can protect itself on the basis of a system of ex post statistical customs surveillance .
we have created frontex and that is excellent .
better quality and more accurate first decisions would save money through fewer costly appeals .
however , we are convinced that this regulation should be significantly improved so as to avoid another case of continuous blockade of transport between member states in total breach of the fundamental principles of the internal market , such as free movement of goods and persons .
in this regard , i have to say that i really would have expected an institute belonging to the government of a member state to observe the minimum requirements of good scientific conduct .
however , it is important to know what exactly is being rated and how .
it goes without saying that regulation and scrutiny are required .
does the commission have real reservations about its safety ?
but there is such a phenomenon and that phenomenon obviously plays a role , and we have to recognise that .
due to the failure to ratify the treaty of lisbon on time , it is desirable , after the 2009 elections , for appointments to be made using a procedure which is much closer to the one provided for in the treaty of lisbon .
parliament , however - and i still believe this is an appropriate request - wanted a clear agreement with the council on how the treaty of lisbon , which the council and parliament adopted together , of course - after all , we are not opponents on this issue - can actually be implemented .
investors , citizens , mainly from the us but also europeans , are suffering its negative impact ; citizens and investors , savers .
in particular , i am pleased that the european union is giving priority to our patients , be they rich or poor .
before spending money , people should know how much is to be spent , before taking a decision people should know how much it costs .
this does not mean that the assad or saleh regimes should be propped up , but it means that the solution should be a negotiated exit strategy rather than a violent and uncontrolled regime change .
in view of this , i am voting in favour of this report requesting the council withdraw its proposal .
i am not asking you to invent new ideas but to take last week 's package presented by the president of the commission and commissioner olli rehn and to put this package with its four cornerstones on the table of the council and the table of your colleagues .
( applause )
this is what we care about , and it is these things that have guided the work of our committee on employment and social affairs .
secondly , per capita gdp in the new member states is lower than in the older ones , as is the level of personal income .
i think the discussions should not end there .
in the meantime , the competent austrian authorities have informed us that mrs maria berger has been elected to the european parliament to replace mrs scheele , with effect from 11 december 2008 .
this needs to be done now .
this is mismanagement of dutch taxpayers ' money .
too much information kills off european citizens .
somebody rightly mentioned the telecom package .
these are the right choices , according to two criteria .
i am aware that two fishing companies from malta have used this agreement to fish in the atlantic .
the alternative is the principle that everyone does what they want and no one does what they should , but everyone does something .
i therefore add my voice to the calls for the authority to take the necessary measures to remedy these shortcomings which , in any case , have not nullified the general regularity and reliability of the budget for the financial year 2009 .
my second preliminary remark , to echo the comments made just now by mr papanikolaou and mr strejček , is that we must improve the way in which these agencies operate .
let me first emphasise the increased forms of accountability that we have negotiated .
let us use all the resources at our disposal during this difficult period of european integration that we are going through .
this is not my analysis , it is the analysis of the international monetary fund ( imf ) , of the organisation for economic cooperation and development ( oecd , of mr trichet , who is , after all , the head of the euro 's monetary guardian , the president of the european central bank , and for whom all the measures that have been taken and all the measures that are in the pipeline do not go far enough .
as the commission has assured us on several occasions , the provisions on the duty drawback include a safeguard clause , which allows for a waiver on the basis of certain criteria .
you have just said that cooperation among small retailers is something you welcome , provided the purchasing agreements are in the order of up to a 20 % share of the market .
my third point relates to the financial markets .
there must be no obligation to install solar panels when building a house , carrying out reroofing works , building an extension or replacing a heating system , such as is the case in the marburg model .
on this point , let me say that since this deals with systems for mining gold and certainly not potatoes , the proprietor companies could easily allocate adequate economic and financial resources to researching technologies that are compatible with the environment and health safety .
no one can solve their economic problems in such a situation as this without coordinating their economic policies .
what is required to increase the effectiveness of cohesion policy is better interaction between the structural funds , as well as better coordination with the other eu financial instruments and domestic assistance .
the labour market available in the eu , regulating the acquis , is not efficient in practice .
it was flatly rejected by the member states .
so , certainly , the commission will defend the fact that we should keep our commitments . for instance , the commitments taken in terms of fast-start financing for the fight against climate change .
that some stupid ignorant people can be allowed to attack what are , in fact , the tragic realities experienced by citizens , individuals and , above all , national governments .
unfortunately , spain , portugal and italy also have high budget deficits .
we are all doubtless in agreement that it is a necessity .
never has there been so much negotiating on the futures market , nor has there been so much money involved .
steps have been taken , but more needs to be done than the current report proposes .
i regret , however , the adoption of mrs trautmann 's oral amendment .
looking at the cost of eur 16 billion deemed necessary for solar energy research , or the eur 5 billion estimated for hydrogen-related technology , this can not be a minor consideration .
eu member states can also make efforts to grant cultural or territorial autonomy to the ethnic minorities living within their territories .
in wishing to help women , there is a risk of penalising them in the job market .
influencing the supervision of the financial markets , climate change , the efforts for economic recovery - these are things that only europe as a whole can do , with its institutions in collaboration .
this higher number is to be achieved by 18 seats being distributed amongst 12 member states and germany losing three seats , but this can not take place as it is unlawful to prematurely curtail the mandate of the three german meps .
over and above the 20/20/20 , the package must include measures on vehicles and aircraft that make the general reduction pledges credible , partly by means of vertical policies .
employment and the whole of the social dimension were main topics of a number of discussions .
this is therefore a measure which , though temporary , is necessary and appropriate .
in writing . - ( it ) madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i voted in favour of mr cottigny 's report on informing and consulting employees in the european community .
without a better treaty , so the argument goes , we are also unable to set up any decent dialogue on human rights .
freedom of expression must be absolute and must certainly cover political views even on controversial issues such as immigration and islam .
we have to continue to underline that the european union wants to work together with all the stakeholders concerned in the arctic to make sure that we face the challenges appropriately .
it has not managed to control the public deficit .
according to the opinion of financial experts , a financial transaction tax that reduces the level of financial speculation and excessive risk taking on the part of financial institutions - long advocated by the group of the progressive alliance of socialists and democrats in the european parliament - can be introduced on a european level without driving out the financial sector from europe .
if the conference of presidents proposes a change in the procedure to the bureau , the bureau will consider it with all due care .
do you agree that a european directive can only lay down requirements that the member states would then have to transpose into national law ?
as representatives of the citizens of europe , we in parliament must comment on this .
naturally , this mission could be carried out with the help of the african union , and there is no reason why third countries could not be involved also .
( ro ) madam president , while both women and children are undoubtedly an important topic , what is important , however , in mr arlacchi 's report is its clarity .
this is the solidarity which we now need internally , so that this freedom can be achieved together with social justice .
the european union had already announced in its action strategy paper at the start of the annapolis process that it is prepared to become involved in this way .
i would like to close by asking the commission to give special consideration to the needs which being an island presents in the forthcoming action plan on transport logistics which it is to present .
today we are marking the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and cutting through the barbed wire .
on behalf of the verts/ale group . - ( fr ) madam president , commissioner , mr lenarčič , i am also speaking for the delegation ; i am in fact chairwoman of the european parliament delegation to the three caucasus countries .
this decision must take account of the fact that on 12 september 2007 malta submitted an application for mobilisation of the fund for 675 redundancies in the textile sector , specifically for workers made redundant by vf ( malta ) ltd and bortex clothing ind .
we all talk about growth , and that is the only way that many of the peripheral economies can climb out of the abyss that they are already in .
( de ) mr president , mr barroso , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to change the tone of this debate and suggest that we all ask ourselves : who among us does not need to grow and develop ?
the commission , of which i am a part , announced the revision of the directive at the beginning of 2005 .
in the light of the recent erika and prestige disasters , human error has emerged as a serious aspect of maritime safety .
i voted in favour of the report even though i am confused as to the appointment of the consumer ombudsman and the means of collective redress .
paperless customs , centralised clearance and a single window will facilitate and support our smes , but it must of course be rigorously pursued by member states if we are to reap the benefits .
on the other hand , there are aspects of the report that we do not like , which is why we are going to abstain .
in writing . - ( fi ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to thank mr panzeri for his excellent report on more effective prevention of undeclared work in the eu .
we know that even within the european union itself , legal systems and legal culture vary greatly .
the proposed framework will contribute to the quality and efficiency of investment in human capital in various different ways , of which i will mention just three : by delivering better education and skills ; by improving standards ; and by promoting mobility .
it has been said that a loss of eur 4.4 million was the result of the suspension of russian imports alone .
they believe that the mind to negotiate will melt away , especially as airlines from the us already have de facto stand alone cabotage to fly from one member state to another , which we can not do on us territory .
while the detailed position of the european union has not been finalised yet , i can explain the principles and priorities which will guide our decisions on the most sensitive issues to be discussed in doha .
protecting children , whether within or outside of the community , is undoubtedly an extremely important goal for the european union .
an improved regulation would establish a better level of transparency .
it is necessary that we also get some case-law from the european court of justice on these issues .
they are top people , the best in the class , the top graduates , yet they are still offered places on the lower-quality training courses and poorer opportunities to advance their careers .
in conclusion , i wish us all good luck .
that person will improve coordination and coherence between the eu institutions and agencies and the member states , will help ensure that best practices are shared in the different member states , develop existing and forthcoming policies and be a contact for third countries .
in every issue , especially one that affects the lives of billions of people in the way that climate change does , it is important to act with moderation , common sense and some degree of fairness when trying to resolve the problem .
this new european regulator will make a strong contribution to enhancing cross-border competition and consumer choice .
in my view , this is an essential principle which must be observed .
commemorating 11 july as a day of remembrance for the victims of the massacre in srebrenica ( debate )
( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the work that has been done regarding the external mandate of the european investment bank ( eib ) .
however , it should be possible for a woman , once she returns to work , to make up for lost working time .
the pact embraces all aspects of managing migratory flows : not only the fight against illegal immigration and the control of borders , but also new areas such as economic immigration , proper harmonisation of asylum and the development of countries of origin .
in spite of it , some members expressed their disagreement with this solution .
we need to focus attention on the urban dimension and to ensure coordination between the funds and the other financial instruments of the european investment bank ( eib ) and european investment fund ( eif ) .
the nord stream gas pipeline , which runs along the floor of the baltic sea , is an exceptional project on account of its size and its potential environmental impact on the baltic region .
what mr schulz said was right , albeit dramatic .
i hope that the joint exchange of experience will help raise employment levels and increase the mobility of the labour market .
it is a vital scheme .
constructive proposals such as the use of milk powder to feed calves , establishing minimum prices for cheese products , clear labelling of cheese analogues and the use of butter fat to assist in the manufacture of ice cream and bakery products have been around for a long time .
i would point out that article 5 of the constitution of the portuguese republic lays down that the state may not alienate any part of the portuguese territory or of the sovereign rights it exercises over it - and that includes rights to adjacent sea beds .
this day presents an excellent opportunity for bringing the eu closer to its citizens through policies connected with consumer protection .
why do we always have this problem and yet in a case like today 's , which is merely an administrative issue , we get this kind of presence and support ?
however , mr barroso , there is one thing i should like to ask you about - and you mention it in the paper you presented to us - namely the european union 's own financial resources .
a greater focus on energy efficiency will mean , first and foremost , that we use less energy .
the hearing we held and the study visit to spain also provided us with interesting insights , and i must thank the rapporteur very sincerely today for having incorporated all our contributions into his report .
the question is also whether smes can find their way amongst all these knowledge and research institutes .
we dealt with it in a resolution in 2005 and we are discussing it again now .
our commitment to a multilateral trading system can be taken for granted .
but in no way did i mean to offend the honourable member , whose record speaks for itself .
i am thinking of xenophobia and homophobia .
we all owe it to our citizens to make constructive policy for europe together .
however , the problem with europe 's human rights values is not limited just to the eastern bloc ; it affects the west too .
the reasons for this absence are procedural ones .
eligibility of housing interventions in favour of marginalised communities (
we accept and we welcome the proposals from the commission for quotas to be done away with by 2015 .
if they decide it is in their country 's interests to enter the single currency , that is their national entitlement and they have made their decision accordingly .
however , as far as 2010 is concerned , the commission has been invited , during the budgetary conciliation phase , to present a revised financial programme designed to ensure the ordered progression of the amounts planned for the period 2010-2013 while retaining an unchanged annual margin level .
member of the commission . - mr president , we are at a moment of transition in the middle east .
the resolution also calls on israel to take steps to ensure the free passage of humanitarian supplies and essential utilities .
the constitutional architecture of the european union is increasingly taking on the form of a nation state .
i must stress , however , that the commission is responsible for transposition of the directives .
when a position of principle is at stake , a person 's religion and ethnicity do not matter .
so it is not an easy task to reach a common approach for a common energy policy and ambitious goals on climate change for europe .
what structural changes can the european union offer the world ?
the harmonious society came to the fore .
there is belarus , there is a trend towards a dictatorship in russia , there is a sliding backwards in ukraine and there are problems in moldova and transnistria .
petitions : see minutes
thank you for the last five years of cooperation .
furthermore , wastefulness , in cases for example , where subsidies for miners are paid to billionaires , is not counted as an error .
commissioner , nautilus , hermes and eur 24 million mean more commitment and more equipment .
the european union has already spent eur 3 billion on kosovo to date .
this is why we think the best way to avoid putting schengen at risk is precisely to reinforce the rules of governance of schengen and clarify some of its aspects .
we need to understand better what the irish said , what they are afraid of and what they hope for .
in light of the problem as a whole , we can see how important it is to have reliable statistics .
in other words , moving away from oil and into renewable energy is a long-term policy , but over the coming 10 to 30 years , demand for oil in europe will not decline .
some of those who clamoured for respect of international law , and the territorial integrity , sovereignty and independence of georgia are , in the end , the same ones who promoted and supported the aggression against yugoslavia .
the financial crisis that the world has gone through has shown that international financial exchanges need to be subject to minimum rules .
i hope this will happen soon .
the majority in government refused any prior agreement which might have resulted in broad and necessary political and social assent .
or how about a commission initiative when , for example - as also happened just recently - a dutch politician can not even obtain permission to enter another european member state , the united kingdom .
much credit for this is due to the position of the group of the progressive alliance of socialists and democrats in the european parliament .
ladies and gentlemen , thank you for expressing your views , which clearly highlighted the many facets of this matter .
where there is a risk that the harvest might be lost , ignorance and the lack of proper assistance to farmers can lead to the uncontrolled use of pesticides .
the commission has already completed a good part of the job .
currently , member states may use labelling to inform consumers about the potential negative effects of consuming alcohol , and this is something that the irish government should certainly consider .
firstly , there was the uk situation that we are discussing and voting on today ; immediately afterwards there were the terrible fires in greece , which you all know about , and not long after that , more floods in slovenia .
every saver wants to know when and how much they are guaranteed to get back .
those in need of credit are the ones who suffer with a new tax .
the issue of visa-free travel in europe can not be considered either a privilege or a diplomatic gesture .
this is not what an energy revolution looks like .
a central issue in this report , however , as in many others , is monitoring .
obviously , i will not always congratulate you , unless you make it clear where you stand on specific problems , dilemmas and crises .
i would also like to make one important remark .
in our view such exchanges would significantly contribute to a more efficient and unified application of community law .
in fact , the coordination regulation we are discussing today brings the adjustments to the laws of the member states into line every year .
since 2005 , the imo ( international maritime organization ) has been cooperating with the ilo ( international labour organization ) and unep ( united nations environment programme ) to draw up binding international rules on the clean dismantling of ships .
we hope this will not be the case . every power should flow into ratification so that we have this treaty by 2009 .
i think it sums up perfectly the issue as it stands today in terms of the commission 's proposals .
i hope that this report will increase openness and transparency of lobbying in parliament .
questions 10 and 11 have been merged as they are very similar , but their authors will both get the chance to put supplementary questions to the minister .
in writing . - the ecr group are united in the view that the trade in human beings is intolerable and should be stopped .
we believe that these will institutionalise inefficiencies in the farming sector .
in writing . - ( pt ) the european police college has had difficulties complying with the standards of good governance expected of any regulatory agency .
the draft text of your amending treaty is not without its faults : the loss of europe 's symbols is a blow to federalists , as is the fudge on voting systems wrought by the poles .
the fact that we have the directive is a good thing , but anyone familiar with the sector feels that it still needs a lot more work .
it will complete the system of protection of fundamental rights within the union , and you know perfectly well that the lisbon treaty does not make this an option but a destination .
we must do this as part of the eu 2020 strategy put forward last week .
europe 's cultural industries contribute to european entrepreneurship , innovation and business , and the eu 's diverse cultural landscape makes it the most attractive tourist destination in the world .
secondly , regarding energy , we need energy efficiency .
madam president , i want to say to mr hökmark , the point that you are making about socialist governments may be true to some extent , but right-wing governments basically choose to do the same thing by piling up private debt instead of public debt .
we have to have a more democratic union which allows citizens to take the initiative .
it will also be a test of our ability to draft an intelligent budget , focused on the areas in which resources can best be deployed and culminating in tangible results , and not on a misdirected budget , because preference was given to political compromise rather than to the quality and efficiency of our spending .
there is therefore no problem here , as i feel that the tenth proposed amendment mentioned has also borne a reassuring solution , since the dutch government has undertaken to notify the relevant citizens in a clarifying circular , so there is now no need for this proposed amendment to be adopted by the parliament .
as a university professor in the usa , he spoke very favourably of european integration and promoted it on the american continent .
it is high time for turkey 's occupation and interference to come to an end so that greek and turkish cypriots can coexist peacefully in the eu .
i would also like to bring to members ' attention some positive recent developments , such as the creation of a human rights office in the gulf cooperation council secretariat .
precisely when people are rescued from such a dramatic situation , the member states , too , must ensure that there is medical and psychological care for them so that they are supported in going back to their countries of origin where appropriate or so that the way is opened to asylum or other similar possibilities here to find a new home and to begin a new life .
the ageing of the population is set to create a shortage of labour and pressure on social security systems .
as a wise old saying of my people has it : 'always hope for the best , but prepare for the worst , and god helps those who help themselves ! '
one of the vital tasks in the realm of development policy is to redirect our efforts towards a sustainable conservationist approach to logging , forestry management and fishing .
i think that is a great pity because kenya is a country that has been politically stable for many decades .
we see again and again how some politicians and non-governmental organisations adopt a rather exaggerated position over the question of gender equality .
for the same reason , some issues have been left out .
( es ) mr president , the gypsies , who are one of the most ancient people groups in europe , deserve the attention of the european union , which they have not received up until now .
in our view , this is the wrong approach .
the last two years have clearly shown that this eu initiative is not aimed at competition , but rather at cooperation with russia , since the stable and self-confident common neighbourhood is in the interests of both the eu and russia .
the second case is that of the european food safety agency , where our initiative is the exact opposite , that is , we recommend putting 10 % in reserve until the agency can demonstrate that it is operating appropriately .
if you intend to put forward modern , sustainable ideas , our group will definitely be behind you .
does the commission intend to do something to guarantee equal , fair treatment for the weaker party in this contract ?
today , the teaching profession is not attractive .
the future security of supply of basic foods requires a strong common agricultural policy ( cap ) .
how , in practice , are farmers supposed to inform all their neighbours and all residents of the local area before they apply plant protection products ?
therefore , i am once again calling on the commission to ensure that the concept is implemented correctly down to the last detail , which means developing useful intermodal nodes and removing the bottlenecks in the transport of goods to and from important european trade gateways .
there are models of local development which have started to address this issue on an area-specific basis .
estimates indicate that between 35 000 and 50 000 employees could benefit from this support each year .
i think there was good cooperation in the process and i thank my colleagues .
when hungarian prime minister viktor orbán presented the programme of the hungarian eu presidency to the european parliament on 19 january , he said : 'the roma strategy is a priority aspect of the hungarian presidency , because there is no point in a smart europe if it has no heart .
concerning the former yugoslav republic of macedonia , bernd posselt , among others , said that we should support the effort of the former yugoslav republic of macedonia , and i think he is right .
i hope that with european leadership , we will achieve success at copenhagen .
i think that the european union 's digital strategy is a crucial factor for this new economy .
i want to emphasise the significance of the change concerning deferred expenditure of the resources envisaged for 2007 .
in writing . - i welcome this agreement and the participation of the republic of croatia in the activities of the european monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction .
it is downright absurd that carcinogenic substances are allowed to get into the hands of children .
i am not in the habit of answering hypothetical questions .
we have no criticisms to make , either as regards the way in which the funds were spent or as regards the level of expenditure .
i would just like to return specifically to the question of electromagnetic fields .
thank you for your kind attention .
creating a labelling system that will ensure that appropriate information is supplied on fuel efficiency and grip , among other characteristics , will allow consumers to make informed choices when purchasing tyres .
i support reaching an agreement on a common methodology for measuring national energy efficiency targets and monitoring progress on achieving them .
we really have to stick to policy coherence so that we do not have success in haiti only to have all our progress ruined because of other harmful policies .
in writing . - ( pl ) i voted in favour of the adoption of amendments 18-21 , namely block 1 .
this capping is necessary so that the 87 % increase from aviation between 1990 and 2004 does not undermine the reduction in other industrial sectors .
yet , given that we do not have uniform conditions , we still see that individual parts of the euro area , individual member states , are having difficulties and we have to respond to that .
existing treaty provisions contain an obligation to work towards equality between women and men .
you do not have a project for transforming europe environmentally and socially .
we have to implement the climate package , the third internal market package and the security of gas supply .
in writing . - ( it ) the last intergovernmental conference on climate change and the various conferences within the united nations framework convention on climate change ( unfccc ) have shown that the greenhouse gases produced by man are the cause of climate change and that the increase in the world 's temperature must be halted at 2°c above pre-industrial levels .
however , on the other hand , it is important to make it clear that we have environmental regulations governing running water and groundwater and the extraction of raw materials from the earth .
the fact that the airport user can not delay airport plans will allow airports to begin infrastructure plans without delay and thus save them - and ultimately air passengers - money , as they will most likely be the beneficiaries of added cost projections .
it would be grounds for concern if the next elections created fault lines in the political palette .
we also know , however , that these reforms can not be put through within the framework of a one-year budget .
despite agreeing with the need to revise the support schemes for farmers , i consider that the commission 's proposals go well beyond what is needed , thereby seriously impacting on the income of farmers who are the guardians of the european rural landscape and of crucial importance to our food sovereignty .
under the treaty , the member states will be committed to increasing military resources for operations outside their territory and in their previous colonies .
ladies and gentlemen , let us all calm down a little .
the language law is not as good as it might be , that has indeed been established .
as mrs grossetête has proposed , we must also list the facilities that meet higher standards . furthermore , with regard to ships reaching the end of their lives , we agree that stricter regulation on the shipment of waste must be enforced .
we are not and never shall be indifferent to your points of view ; we do not claim , and never have claimed , to be perfect or to say that all we have done was well done , irreproachable or not open to criticism .
( applause )
we are prepared to give you our vote , but you need to promise to stop the negotiations with turkey , to make sure that the netherlands is no longer the largest net contributor to this bureaucratic eu , and to work towards a europe of sovereign member states rather than the federal superstate to which you aspire .
written statements ( rule 116 ) : see minutes
will the commissioner rename the sixth european industrial initiative simply the 'nuclear energy initiative ' ?
i would have thought , as the authors of the mercosur question , we should at least have been afforded the decency of being consulted as to why this has happened .
i particularly wanted to share this analysis with you , and i will tell the council about it at its meeting on 9 october , when we will be looking at the last two texts .
the agency has significantly improved its financial management over the last three years , which is very welcome , and it should continue to strive for the highest standards in budgetary planning , implementation and control .
to address irrational energy pricing we should probably consider the creation of an independent energy regulators in all member states who would have the competancy to ensure that any increase in pricing levels of public utilities like energy and water , drainage , airport charges etc ... , would have to be justified .
we must have clear rules regarding the eu budget for the transitional period between the treaty of nice and the treaty of lisbon .
recently there was a proposal to prohibit smoking in public places , when at the same time , in the centre of the capital city , you can buy thousands of packets of contraband cigarettes .
yesterday 's 'polish plumber ' will tomorrow be chinese or pakistani .
the conclusions of this thoughtful report , on the other hand , offer cogent indications as to how that transformation can be made and how serbia can once again take its place in europe .
mr rouček and mrs de keyser are absolutely right to say that a great deal of education is needed , with or without magritte .
in view of the fact that the number of new cases of tuberculosis throughout the world is still a cause for concern four years before the deadline for achieving the millennium development goals ( mdgs ) , we should intervene immediately .
the action plan will guide us in delivering an ambitious set of very concrete measures in a field where the added value of europe will be very visible to our citizens .
i highly value the process that has led us to the approval of the new treaty .
like many of my fellow members , i deplore the fact that the council has further reduced an already meagre budget : the commitment appropriations of the draft budget represent a total amount of eur 134 billion , that is to say , a shortfall of eur 469 million with regard to the pdb , even though the payments stand at eur 115 billion , this being a decrease of eur 1.8 billion .
for example , additional security can be obtained by someone using a credit card , but not if the billing is taking place , for example , in my own country , the republic of ireland .
it is all very fine voting for this - and i voted for it because i helped to negotiate it - but because of that , i realise that it also has its weaknesses .
the commission believes that its recent proposal for a directive would be a more suitable instrument to achieve our common objective of protecting children from child sex offenders .
the situation is now very grave .
i voted in favour of this resolution on the return and reintegration of detainees from the guantánamo detention centre .
what we are talking about here is 'renewable energy sources ' and that is where we shall achieve over 40 % .
ms gomes has produced a truly exceptional report , whose findings are derived directly from her first-hand experience on the ground .
i would like to emphasise the points on which , in my view , the member states will have to move in order for parliament to accept an agreement .
what do we tell the banks ?
it is the first in a new generation of free trade agreements which contain both a chapter on sustainable development and compliance with labour standards and a monitoring mechanism in which civil society will be involved .
there must be some directive which the companies are breaching .
i agree with the commission 's proposal aiming to introduce an additional , simpler method of using european social fund reserves to ensure that it can react more quickly and effectively to the economic and social difficulties that europe is facing .
with one voice you have just taken on a responsibility that i hope you will not come sorely to regret .
madam president , i congratulate my colleague , ms gomes , on an excellent report .
commission declaration relating to article 20 ( 6 ) ( d ) , ( 7 ) and ( 8 )
it is important not to take a regime of restrictive measures out of context , or when implementing these measures , to believe that everything will fall into place automatically .
do not accuse me of racism , please be serious .
it is far too early to draw any conclusions on the changes that might be needed .
the cohesion policy must remain a strong and well-financed policy , and i would therefore emphasise the necessity of retaining the financial resources for objective 2 .
institutions across europe and in member states who were responsible for dealing with such issues were absolutely paralysed and , quite frankly , if it had not been so serious , it would have been practically laughable .
the discussion was very interesting indeed .
finally , i would like to say that i will certainly report your comments to my colleague , mr mandelson , to be taken fully into consideration in the discussions with other wto members .
they merely permit the technical and substantive preparation of a political decision .
because we have no luxury of time and , instead , i urge everyone to take decisions as soon as possible , so that we can make europe 2020 a success and create real foundations for sustainable growth and job creation in europe .
what are the next specific steps ?
on this point , i must say that the council can not say any more than what was said on monday in conciliation , although i know that parliament was unable to agree with that at the time .
these measures represent the immediate answer to the situation .
madam president , the fact that , during the difficult crisis period that europe and the world are going through at the moment , parliament has been able to adopt the first directive since the entry into force of the treaty of lisbon at first reading says a great deal about this house 's sensitivity .
this agreement is aimed at ensuring the traceability and certification of timber products from the republic of congo .
i think it is important not to invest exclusively in the area of technology , either , which is an important area .
cooperation with the french presidency and the council was very fruitful .
this is not about eu global weakness in foreign affairs , but about russian bullying and revanchism in the south caucasus .
i am presuming that glaring errors have been made in this regard , and once again , we are finding out that there are loopholes .
the moldovan people 's choice of the european option is now also shown at a political level .
on the other hand , legislation which is underpinned and supported by scientific arguments , with input from all parties , and which will eventually lead to legislation that is acceptable for all , whilst still being workable - now , that will lead to greater prosperity in europe .
it says , 'men and women shall be given equal pay for equal work ' .
we do so of course for the benefit of citizens in europe and in canada , but also to promote security and prosperity worldwide .
fourth , eu raw materials policy must ensure that the union does not become a hostage , for example , to russia in the case of gas , and perhaps in future to brazil in the case of sugar .
i voted in favour because this agreement involves promoting cooperation at sub-regional level , thus respecting the european goal of strengthening the framework of regional fishery management organisations as a means of promoting fishery governance .
these objectives have now been reinforced in the plan for the near future , the europe 2020 strategy .
when you yourself , mr van rompuy , say that the euro has brought us stability , i suppose i could applaud you for having a sense of humour .
the director of the company , mr flick , has not seen fit to respond to questions from meps and simply ignores complaints from the general public .
if it appears that my answer to one of your questions is not good enough or is wrong , i will gladly admit this and i will rectify it , of that you may be sure .
there is a lot that is good and positive about the report on the rights of passengers in bus and coach transport .
but this is a rare example of a report that is on the right road - to damascus ?
we have managed to strike a balance that will give us simple procedures , which can be applied without compromising the standard of small and medium-sized enterprises and , at the same time , the best possible result .
the ability to establish the end point of the life-cycle of by-products is a significant step forward .
the recent accession of many new members - one might just mention china and the forthcoming entry of russia - highlights the success of a body now comprising 152 countries .
the placing of biocidal products on the market - new biocides revision proposal ( debate )
i reaffirm these commitments today , adjusted of course only to the time that has elapsed since then .
it has been the most successful development partner at fulfilling its commitments , notably in terms of market access , rules of origin and debt alleviation .
europe 's citizens can not bear the costs alone for modernising energy systems .
however , we are prepared to have a more in-depth debate on the issue of regulating the credit rating agency sector itself once the commission has provided us with its proposal on the comprehensive review of this sector , which is set for next year .
of course , president barroso has to defend his commissioners , including mr mccreevy .
these are the parties that constitute the three-party coalition in bulgaria : godless individuals who bombed churches to make an impression on the comintern , such as the bulgarian socialist party ( bsp ) is ; a party compiled around the heir of boris iii who involved bulgaria in world war ii and did not miss kissing with hitler - these are the thieves from the simeon ii national movement ( snm ) - and , finally , the anti-constitutional muslim party of the movement for rights and freedoms ( mrf ) which consists of terrorists who blew up railway carriages for mothers with children just about twenty years ago .
yet for the western balkans and turkey , which have a clear membership perspective , the eu must not impose new intermediate stages before candidacy or accession .
of course , nobody should be naive .
furthermore , we enthusiastically welcomed the proposal to subject these foodstuffs to an advance ethical opinion , to avoid the circulation on our market of foods deriving from endangered species , or the consumption of foods which would be reproachable for us europeans .
may this resolution , coming as it does in 2008 , the 75th anniversary of the famine , be a mark of our fellow feeling for the people of ukraine and especially the survivors of the famine , as well as the families and relatives of the victims .
how can we trust the un and the first countries of asylum to organise such a check ?
the council should now move swiftly to approve their inclusion .
everyone knows of the sorrows and the cultural genocide in tibet , and everyone feels sympathy , and it is only right to ask the important question : where is the eu in all this ?
i was going up and down in the lift when the doors jammed and i could hardly get here in time for the debate .
you tell me to wake up , but , in all friendship , mr wurtz , i would be afraid to advise you not to think too hard about what happened during the 20th century , because sincere men like you would then see that they have been supporting systems that are far removed from the ideals of their youth .
it is our duty to do everything we can to control the influx of migrants .
certain members have taken the opportunity to attack the government of spain while they had the floor .
this instrument should be adopted by the end of 2008 .
in writing . - ( nl ) the new telecoms law that we are discussing today has far-reaching consequences for all of us internet and telecom users .
what are the main measures that have been announced , apart from a welcome but insufficient increase of eib loans to small and medium-sized enterprises ?
author . - ( de ) mr president , our former oldest member , otto von habsburg , was once asked whether he regretted being an mep rather than an emperor .
we should try to help our own people and by the same token help others .
all of these things have been explained .
the selected individuals , from our party , the liberals and the socialist party , are all very valid persons , and we should not have the competence to start debating as from now , prior to the hearing , whether we can change the portfolios of the commissioners .
a second responsibility lies , to my mind , with the neighbouring countries , particularly the serb authorities .
allow me to say that it is all very well to say , 'in my country i do not want identity cards and i do not want a common immigration policy ' , but this does not stop you from being quite happy for foreigners whose papers are not in order to be stopped in france so that you do not have them in the united kingdom .
the report also makes some criticisms of the action plan , particularly where it states that this 'is bound to fail at least in part , since it is designed solely to accompany existing community policies , it is not based upon a preventive policy intended to reduce illnesses linked to environmental factors , and it pursues no clear , quantified objective . '
first , the outflow of migrant workers into tunisia , egypt , algeria and niger - there the commission and the member states have been very effective .
the mikolášik report is deserving of support .
these causes , which are rooted in the capitalist relations of production , can not be eliminated as long as these relations exist .
the report adopted today by parliament concerns the important issue of product safety and , consequently , of the protection of citizens .
i fully concur with this view .
( applause )
mr van rompuy , my question is as follows : how long is europe going to be expected to be the miracle worker of financial capital ?
written statements ( rule 142 )
eu trade policy pays little attention to the specific nature of this sensitive sector and the interests of eu producers .
( de ) mr president , i specifically said that that would have to take place in cooperation with the arab league and with arab countries .
our duty as the commission is to have controls and to see that member states do their duty .
we also succeeded in ensuring that the basic principles we have always represented are maintained in the treaty of lisbon .
we have already noted that the tourism industry generates more than 5 % of gdp in the european union , involving nearly two million small and medium-sized enterprises and contributes an employment rate that exceeds 12 % .
yes , there is the precautionary principle , and we need to be mindful of this , but decisions also need to be evidence-based , and i would have liked a little more evidence in this matter .
development of the trans-european transport network , provision for motorways of the sea and development of the intermodality of means of transport would lead to the creation of a european maritime transport system that is competitive and receptive to innovations .
nor can beekeepers cope alone with protecting their markets and ensuring the viability of their products .
documents received : see minutes
russia has withdrawn from eastern europe , which not so long ago was ruled by the implacable communist dictatorship .
i believe that a common european immigration policy must prove to be a policy supporting solidarity with member states located at the eu 's borders , which suffer large influxes of immigrants .
the next item is the report by mrs stauner , on behalf of the committee on employment and social affairs , on the future of social security systems and pensions : their financing and the trend towards individualisation .
i should like to reply to two or three of those speeches .
with this in mind , strengthening the african union in institutional and operational terms is a priority ;
i fear that the problem here is that this monitoring has degenerated into a process of exchanging letters between officials in brussels and in the capitals of the member states , without there being any political input .
i am sure that the saa will bring concrete economic and trade benefits for the country in areas such as environment , energy , transport and many others .
i would like to add my thanks to my fellow committee members , to mr böge and to the two rapporteurs for their hard work on this budget .
the tenacity and courage that its people have been demonstrating in the face of these difficulties should be inspiring for a europe which often seems too self-absorbed and is not always sufficiently aware of what is going on beyond its borders .
when we reduce soil pollution , marine pollution is reduced as well .
yet if there is an area in which we need more from europe , more restricting community regulations , it is this one .
i refer to the charter of the united nations , the european convention on human rights and the energy charter treaty .
we rejected all proposals that would reduce the political groups ' independence .
are these truly complementary ?
the fact that there are better and worse situations , depending on geographical location and the date of accession to the european union , really demonstrates that there is no common agricultural policy and that there will not be one for some considerable time to come .
we voted in favour of this report , but we voted against , and are strongly opposed to , the recommendation for the introduction of a financial transaction tax and the distribution of the debt amongst the countries of the euro area .
i mention this , especially as in the coming months , the european union will have to define and adapt its future cohesion policy and 2020 strategy , as well as the conditions for their successful implementation .
we have often heard that the commission is losing its ability to safeguard the legitimate interests of producers , workers and consumers and something certainly went wrong in its communication with both sides of industry in a negotiation that was sometimes criticised for its lack of transparency .
secondly , use of cross-border healthcare must be based on the informed choice of the patient , and not on coercion .
this is one of the objectives of the consumer market scoreboard on which we are working and which i believe will be supported by the commission pretty soon .
i wish the spanish presidency every success in achieving its priorities and in finding solutions to the challenges which the european union is currently facing .
our group 's response therefore at this point is : the principle of 'equal pay for equal work in the same establishment ' must occupy an equivalent position in the internal market with regard to the criteria of freedom .
at a time when we are striving , in europe , to achieve a resource-efficient and sustainable economy , this data will allow us to link environmental factors to economic ones and thus offers the possibility of more comprehensive and better-informed policy making .
in its evaluation report for the two years after this directive entered into effect , the commission should have been much more courageous and should have proposed a unified and binding method for calculating security charges throughout the eu .
there are also some very positive things that have been produced .
a state can raise its taxes only up to a certain level before the money begins to go abroad and the revenues dwindle .
consequently , this package is by no means balanced .
we have got to get it right at member state level , and we have got to insist that each member state implement this directive in the right and proper way in each and every member state .
the far-reaching effects of globalisation are resulting in more and more people losing their jobs .
member of the commission . - madam president , the european commission shares the deep concerns of this parliament - so explicitly and clearly expressed by the honourable members - as regards the human rights situation in iraq .
it was a victory for civil society , and is a good argument in the continuing debate in other member states .
for these reasons i abstained on the report .
in the face of crisis , europe has shown that it really exists and has demonstrated its added value .
eighteen years ago , as leader of the opposition in east timor , you showed great courage and great vision .
these are proposals that aim objectively to improve and correct aspects of the regulation in force that are inadequate and anachronistic .
the report promotes giving many civil and health-associated liberties to individuals who have illegally entered many eu countries .
therefore agriculture strategy , consumption strategy , land treatment , river regulation and , if water needs to be diverted , it should be .
throughout my political and personal career , i have always strongly believed that , through engagement and dialogue , even the most difficult issues can be addressed and hopefully , when the time is right , can also be solved .
firstly , because the level of ambition agreed at the 2007 spring summit translates to a much higher than 20 % reduction in today 's economic circumstances .
we can not afford to leave our neighbours dealing alone with security issues , organised crime and illegal migration .
through a neutral , inclusive and consensual transition process .
we propose that the claims against member states in respect of staff pensions , estimated at eur 37 billion at 31 december 2008 , be entered in the accounts as an asset .
it is quite clear what the common thread is between soviet socialism and national socialism .
we must not downplay the significance of these crimes , and we must not deny them .
first , hamas terrorists fired rockets , then israel retaliated disproportionately , and once again it is difficult to distinguish between civilian and military casualties .
( pl ) mr president , i agree with the fellow member on many issues .
she has identified the main problems as being the different sanctions available in the member states and the problem of how to operate mutual recognition when one 's own system has no precise equivalent .
the european union will go to bali with the same sense of purpose that has guided it over the last 15 years , during which we unhesitatingly and unambiguously took on the role of leader of the international community in this great global challenge .
mr president , in some of our member states it is possible for people to walk in off the street and receive training in the use of guns , and indeed magnum guns , without any identification whatsoever , or without having a gun licence .
the rapporteur 's proposal not to establish a new european monitoring centre for migratory flows is particularly worthy of support .
some stumbling blocks remain , in particular concerning denuclearisation and relations with russia .
and the list could go on and on and on .
these same political forces are those constituting the great alliance in the council , the european commission and the european parliament : the group of the european people 's party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats , the socialist group in the european parliament , the group of the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe , the group of the greens/european free alliance and other supporters of the european 'monolith ' , with the participation of the new democracy and pasok meps .
let us be honest with the turks .
it is absolutely incomprehensible that the funding for training and education could be cut at this point .
there must be an end to both .
during our next plenary session in strasbourg we will hear the european commission ' report on the humanitarian aid provided and the conditions for the provision of aid there .
we need have no second thoughts , however , about you , madam president , being able to express the disapproval of this house .
cease all negotiations with turkey and other islamic countries .
this requirement , coupled with the rule to reduce capacity by 60 % and to limit this capacity to 25 % in order to support new vessels , makes this measure completely unfeasible , as my colleague mr casaca said a short while ago .
this is one of the elements which cast doubt on the prospects for beating the recession .
- before the vote :
first i should like to mention that the judgment in case t-228/02 of 12 december 2006 , known as the ompi case ( organisation des modjahedines du peuple d'iran v council of the european union ) , does not justify the conclusion that the eu practice of terrorist lists is in breach of eu legislation .
draftsman of the opinion of the committee on economic and monetary affairs . - ( de ) many thanks , mr president .
what we require is action for the long term , rather than short-term reactions .
i believe that pressure from european institutions will help ease the repression of belarusian citizens .
the committee 's opinion was toned down in this respect , and i am glad to see that , thanks also to efforts in the committee on the internal market and consumer protection , most of the excessively protectionist aspects have been mitigated .
however , this fund has its limitations .
on behalf of the verts/ale group . - ( fi ) madam president , ladies and gentlemen , my sincere thanks go to mr schnellhardt for his excellent work and cooperation .
the blue flag is already on all the bank notes and car number plates .
mr olbrycht , partnership can be expressed through sharing good practice and , at the request of the towns , through a set of guidelines concerning , for example , the use of a town 's central infrastructure , or through more harmonised information : sometimes there are signs that show a motorway in one colour in one town or member state , but in another colour in a different town or member state .
since autumn last year , more than 5 million european citizens have lost their jobs , giving a total of 22.5 million unemployed in europe .
the same applies , by the way , to insurance premiums .
many of you asked about frontex 's ability at present to assist people whose boats have been shipwrecked .
( the president cut off the speaker )
such large hydroplants destroy vast amounts of nature and drive people from their homes .
mr daul highlighted perfectly what changes should be made in relation to the objectives that remain , particularly as regards the energy/climate package .
and kaliningrad is , of course , a very special case , due to its unique geographic location .
the second thing is this : you are three years , now , into a five-year term .
it is like 1989 and the european union needs special procedures - this house , the commission , the council , the eas - and we welcome cathy ashton 's down payment for democracy , but we need to do more .
in this respect , i shall offer you a suggestion .
i believe that , in order to respond to the complexity of the challenges of the sahel , we have to act at various different levels .
it is a duty imposed on us by our concern for the future of europe .
the migration of parents abroad for work is a social phenomenon with a complex impact on the dynamics and functionality of the family , as well as on the whole of society .
is unanimity intended only for issues which divide us rather than for the fundamental consensus on which europe is based ?
indeed , we can no longer ignore the social and economic dumping practised by companies in emerging countries who are winning contracts in countries of the union , in defiance of social rights and legislation on state subsidies , while , in the meantime , the markets of these countries are closed to european companies .
i would like to thank our fellow member , as well as all of you who signed this declaration .
when you complain , therefore , complain to the right place .
that does not stop me , or my colleague and friend , mr rehn , who addressed you this morning , from saying that i was surprised - and mr mölzer also expressed his surprise - at the timing of this latest rating of greece by one of the agencies yesterday .
in writing . - i voted for this resolution to repeal council regulation ( ec ) no 1964/2005 on the tariff rates for bananas .
of course , enforcement may be difficult , but that is not a reason for inaction .
we will also have to close provisionally some chapters with financial implications .
for once , children in our society know more than parents , which is not such a bad thing , but it creates problems for parents in helping their children to overcome the problem .
in this regard , we ought to ask ourselves whether we are really getting enough for the money that we spend on salaries .
to mr schmidt , i would say that we really ought not to mix things up and speak in the same breath about taxation and health .
there are people still living today in poland and in the baltic states who have lost their parents , their grandparents , but no one remembers them .
it is a country with an educated and industrious workforce that could do extremely well pricing itself into the market and exploiting the advantages of relatively cheap exports ; but i am a democrat , and of course , if the people of croatia vote in favour of eu accession , if that is their considered will , then i will support their bid when it comes before this chamber .
in writing . - recycling and prevention of waste , air emissions and climatic change and sustainable consumption and production could be monitored much more effectively if high-quality data were available regarding the interaction between environmental and economic factors .
in the past , an american marshall plan saved the economy of europe .
the second problem is the humiliating treatment of migrants .
the obligations of toy importers have been made more stringent .
it strengthens the notion of citizenship , which is at the very root of the european project .
both parties fail to realise that all of this is completely incomprehensible to other europeans .
what we need are legal immigrant workers with rights and obligations , not slaves .
economic well-being and social cohesion are essential conditions for the emancipation of a people and the smooth running of a country .
what is important is that the present crisis should result in the creation of a democratic regime and rule of law and the creation of a hardcore muslim state that will destabilise the region should be avoided .
it is important to support clean coal technologies and to intensify our activities as regards second and third generation biofuels as well as to increase research into nuclear power .
this will bring about a tangible strengthening of the ombudsman 's position and therefore also of the legal status of the citizens .
in your composition - if i may put it that way - you mention a 'sudden crisis of confidence ' .
also on 6 january 2009 , as the gas supplies were severely reduced to several eu member states , leading to a major supply disruption , an extremely strong statement by the presidency and the commission was issued , calling on both sides to immediately and unconditionally resume gas supplies to the eu .
i voted in favour of the own-initiative report by my french colleague and friend mrs sudre , which she wrote in response to the commission communication on the strategy for the outermost regions ( ors ) .
in writing . - ( sk ) gas emissions from aircraft have doubled since 1990 and are continuing to increase .
therefore labelling is required if the market is to function in this respect .
madam president , i voted against this simply because the proposal has been hijacked in effect by the committee on the environment , public health and food safety and commissioners .
the rapporteur proposed dropping all the wordings about sound public finances , the breaches of the stability and growth pact ( sgp ) which need to be brought to an end and the importance of the strict enforcement of the sgp and 250 members actually supported him in this .
in this context we organised a hearing as part of our deliberations in the committee on transport and tourism , where we were told by the industry representatives - not entirely surprisingly - that anything was possible .
vice-president of the commission . - madam president , i would like to thank parliament and the rapporteurs in particular for supporting the commission on these important agreements .
you all deserved your holiday .
youth unemployment is one of the most pressing problems facing europe .
( fr ) i am sorry , mr president .
of course it is right that the budgets of each of the institutions are part of the wider system of control and scrutiny .
too much stress , too much suspicion , too much ambition and greed i also think are factors which destroy our inner peace .
i will close by saying that we must react , for we can not accept honey coming from elsewhere - the quality is lower and it does not meet our strict production criteria - as being inevitable , as the only alternative to the dearth of honey that is slowly taking hold in europe .
the commission alone has spent a total of almost eur 3 billion on this in the past 15 years .
so this fruit scheme is welcome .
therefore , it should be greeted with satisfaction .
these issues need to be resolved before we sign this fta , in order to ensure free and fair trade .
all of this will take place in spring 2011 , with crd 4 and these legislative texts .
mr president , allow me to begin in a very similar way to mrs gräßle , with an expression of great esteem for mr kallas and the court of auditors for their ongoing cooperation , which has meant that from year to year , when we look at the statistics , we see a clear improvement in management of the budget , reporting , annual reports and evaluations .
co2 consumption must be taxed , and kerosene taxes must be brought in at long last .
( pt ) mr president , experience has shown that there is no balance between competition and the defence of social and workers ' rights .
i also disagree with plans to base the eu social model on benefit distribution , otherwise our next discussion will be solely on migration .
what we have to ensure is that the foundation stones that we put down today will be as strong in 15 years ' time as they are today , that they will continue to deliver economic growth and that they will continue to deliver security of energy supply .
following delays and cost increases linked to the securing of the three power plants , the report invites the commission to exercise greater supervision , to establish what the current state of play is and the expected timeframe for the completion of different phases of the decommissioning process according to the original timetable .
this is because until now people had limited opportunities to choose the court , which would consider their divorce case .
the next item is the vote .
leading from this , member states can decide on its prioritisation and sharing of best practice .
this is why i would like to emphasize some budgetary aspects of the european union 's support for the sport sector .
every weekend , i meet business people who can not get credit , particularly in my country .
now we are becoming a political union and a genuine community of interests .
as members know , we are pursuing a range of bilateral agreements in conjunction with this .
( hu ) mr president , the report we have just adopted , entitled 'on the situation of fundamental rights in the european union ' , is comprehensive and represents a breakthrough in several aspects .
our problem concerns the fact that not all of the eu 's member states apply the same criteria with regard to the export of dual-use items .
special emphasis must be put on preventing youth unemployment , for which it is necessary to harmonise training supply with labour-market demand , provide middle-term national and regional forecasts on expected labour demand and enable national education systems to be more effective in guaranteeing the attainment of those skills that are actively sought on the labour market .
mr president , mr rübig has accused me twice now of bringing a firearm into the chamber .
as parliament has once again missed the opportunity of demonstrating to the citizens of europe its clear commitment to making savings , behaving responsibly with taxpayers ' money and giving up its privileges , i have voted against the report .
i therefore call on the council to make sufficient refinancing of harvests and food stocks its number one priority .
in writing . - ( fr ) i welcome the adoption of the joint resolution on the 'barcelona process : union for the mediterranean ' .
in economic terms , tunisia achieved an average growth rate of 4.6 % between the years 2002 and 2008 .
the differences of course relate to the composition of the energy mix .
this is a commission-style deal which is more suited to a command economy .
erroneous decisions by governments in economic and financial policy and inadequate financial supervision by governments and the manifest collapse of a number of banks are reason to call for a reformed financial system , not a new economic system .
it is 27 years ago that the gdańsk shipyard workers launched their fight against the communist system and for bread and freedom .
( fr ) madam president , what mrs liotard has just said is absolutely incredible .
this is not all doom and gloom .
tyre manufacturers also stand to benefit , of course .
the price per barrel has increased by 63 % since 2007 ; it is true that it has decreased today , but i do not think it has fallen enough to be sustainable .
you have mentioned the three ms : money , mobility and market access .
on behalf of the pse . - ( es ) commissioner , we have already noted here that the european schools were , as official centres of instruction , established jointly by the governments of the member states of the union to provide multilingual and multicultural education primarily to the children of the staff of the institutions and that for many reasons they now need to be reformed , essentially in the light of new needs .
elevate 's project offers victims a safe haven and supports them in rebuilding their confidence and ability to function in society .
however , we can not support the use of the passerelle in article 67 ( 2 ) , indent 2 , of the ec treaty as suggested by mr coelho .
as you can see , it is quite intense .
this is obviously a basic consideration .
in relation to national priorities in the context of the trans-european transport network ( ten-t ) , i consider it important to invest not only in railways but , above all , in motorways of the sea and the interoperability and cooperability of the various kinds of transport .
demonstrate , just as mr schulz said , that we understand that energy policy is also social policy , industrial policy and a policy for the future .
in the uk , the new government has already indicated that there is a need for a major package of financial savings this year .
these are areas of concern in which we need to make changes in the future in order to prevent and avoid bad management , irregularities , fraud , conflicts of interest and , at the end of the day , bad expenditure .
member states that wish to do this through statutory minimum wages are free to do so .
we have to grow biofuels sustainably .
the call for new nuclear power plants in europe is unacceptable .
please now allow me to make a few brief comments on the report .
we support the commission in using this package of initiatives to increase efficiency , promote scientific and technical progress , provide benefits to end consumers and , in short , improve the overall competitiveness and sustainable development of our businesses .
it was a long and painful process and everyone who played a part can now look back on it with a clear conscience .
it is already time for mubarak to go ; his time has passed .
member of the commission . - mr president , eu-us relations have had a positive , fresh start under the new administration of president obama .
it is in the eu 's interest and , indeed , it is in turkey 's .
dual-use goods that have civilian and military applications must also come under the code of conduct , as must re-exports .
it is also currently the only body in which the belarus opposition is involved .
in writing . - i voted in favour of the college of commissioners , expressing my trust in the president of the commission most of all .
hundreds of thousands of people lost their lives , and many bear the consequences of the radiation to this day in the form of disease and death through cancer .
for example , the withdrawal of milk quotas and the abolition of the set-aside scheme have been unsuccessful decisions as far as less favourable regions are concerned .
we also urge greater efforts to decrease the frequency of refunding non-eligible expenditures , and we would like to draw the attention of the commission to the need to accelerate decision-making processes relating to financial adjustments .
thank you for your attention .
although the report acknowledges this need and suggests some important measures that we consider positive , it nonetheless opens the door to solutions that we view with concern and can not accept , such as lifting the zero tolerance for the presence in imported feed of gmos , which puts the strict application of the precautionary principle at risk .
we were informed that the colombian government or , in any event , that body , is seeking to artificially create links between her and guerrilla groups , namely the farc .
it is also unacceptable , however , for us to expose israel and not to manage to defend it actively against all attacks and terrorist activities aimed against citizens of the state of israel .
the debate is closed .
belarus ( debate )
the key issue is supporting small and medium-sized businesses .
the european union and europe as a whole is opening itself up to immigrants from various countries around the world .
the gender perspective has definitely become more important at an international level .
there must be an understanding of such measures throughout our union , and i believe that we have succeeded in finding the right balance .
they asked me to extend this invitation to you , which i have now done .
the commission is at present preparing a communication on a strategy for the sustainable development of eu aquaculture , which should be finalised by the end of 2008 .
i believe that this is an unacceptable argument that contradicts itself , because the fact that we are not going to achieve 20 % energy efficiency is precisely why we do not set binding targets to do so .
eu market access for european companies ( debate )
in writing . - i support moves to review the current restrictions on the quantity of liquids passengers are allowed to carry on board aircraft in the eu .
closure of the sitting
but for it to succeed there must be solidarity among the citizens of europe .
the foreign affairs minister of one large eu member state said that if slovenia became independent , other countries would isolate it for 50 years .
these two examples give us food for thought about the manner of cooperation between the european union and the united states when it comes to the fight against terrorism .
i am in no way opposed to this principle , so i voted for the proposal .
the practice of such maladministration endangers the rights of eu citizens .
because the school textbooks our children study , our newspapers and broadcast media , our libraries and all these documents and files , they all resemble what you find in the novel nineteen eighty-four .
i believe this is a huge step forward for the interests of the european union .
in writing . - i voted in favour of this resolution on the green paper from the commission on policy options for progress towards a european contract law for consumers and business .
this was provided for in the commission 's initial text , but the ppe , with the rapporteur 's support , opposed this proposal .
we need loyalty , and that is why we postulate that inter-state applications should not be brought concerning an alleged failure of compliance when the act falls within the scope of union law .
the report gained very strong support within the special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable european union after 2013 .
i also think that it is of paramount importance to offer people with disabilities access to europeana 's digital content .
i have faith in the role that the us will continue to play in this regard under the leadership of president-elect obama .
this must be how to interpret these guidelines , which , under the deceitful guise of flexicurity , have the objective of increasing flexibility in labour markets , work organisation and labour relations , including what they advocate on amending labour law by revising , where necessary , various contract terms and provisions on working time .
i regret , however , that the proposal to increase cofinancing rates in the area of additional data collection , management and use to 60 % of eligible expenditure has not been adopted .
the service will , at the end of the day , represent the european union in all its aspects , hence the emphasis on accountability , transparency and coherence .
we must give priority to the countless initiatives included in this report , together with those already developed by other institutions , which it expressly supports , in line with the measures included in the commission 's emergency plan .
on behalf of the gue/ngl group . - ( de ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , this is a really important moment , because today , for the first time in the european parliament , we are commemorating the roma and sinti victims of the holocaust .
this is the only way to provide a chance for the survival of the stock .
we lost by 8 votes , because 20 european countries which are now members of the european union collaborated with each other and abstained .
with that i wish you all a happy christmas !
this focus is not helped by the commission 's concentration on the idea of employment security as opposed to job security , which is repeated in both the green paper on labour law and the communication on flexicurity .
as far as the european social fund is concerned , experience shows that funding the economic measures of the european regional development fund can be more effective if it is better coordinated and is integrated into the activities performed by this fund .
the second concerns the internal market .
this is therefore the best compromise but it is not a socialist report .
without proportion on a world scale , we are only increasing the competitive edge of china , india and brazil .
there is also a request that we conclude the debate with the tabling of motions for resolutions and vote on these during the february part-session .
existing eu laws on discrimination continue to prove difficult to implement in practice .
the times we live in are very demanding and european institutions play an essential role ; it is a crucial role , in which they must not fail , and they therefore need to have sufficient means at their disposal .
on the one hand , we recognise the efforts made , namely adoption of the law on foundations , reform of the penal code regarding freedom of expression , and the constitutional changes announced .
the task of civil society does not lie solely in taking part in elections .
surely the new turkmen discovery of gas should galvanise you into action .
i should like , in any case , to ask those of my fellow members who are able to support me in this matter to call on every citizen to take out civil liability insurance to cover any damage to third parties .
that treaty does not introduce a specific legal basis , but gives the value of a european policy to the strategy we are discussing here today and which hitherto was based on a common political resolve .
commissioner , it is not right that the commission is preventing the member states from conducting policies of social diversity .
we must not forget underwater nuclear testing in this respect .
knowing the consultations being carried out at present in the council , we are waiting to hear how the commission will work to safeguard national autonomy of action and create an effective basis for cooperation , so that the question of habit and the question of fraud can be combated .
it was commuted but not cancelled .
could you provide us with this information ?
how can pakistan even call itself a democracy when the freedom of religion that is granted by the constitution is completely ignored by applying the blasphemy laws , to which the late salmaan taseer was so opposed .
social security and employment policies play a very important role in reducing the poverty people endure .
i should put both hands up in that regard .
i also received positive signals for extending and deepening cooperation on my visit to the central asian nations last october , when i visited kazakhstan , uzbekistan and turkmenistan .
i therefore call on the commission to state whether it will correct this fundamental error , or whether we will have to correct it as members in committees .
its official task was to defend the member states ' common territory against foreign invasions , without taking action outside of that territory .
with that in mind , the council expresses its readiness to work together with parliament in a spirit of good cooperation with a view to putting in place a modern , comprehensive and fully functional legal framework which will be conducive to developing countries ' needs .
statement by the president
i therefore believe that we need a technological revolution , and this summit ought to be setting us on the right course .
( fr ) mr president , mrs ashton , the death and disappearance of the body of seyed ali mousavi , the nephew of the leader of the iranian opposition , is one of many tragic examples that show the current malaise of the islamic republic of iran .
in this context , i would also like to emphasise the role of the relevant monitoring bodies , for example customs authorities , which shoulder considerable responsibility for the direct monitoring of exports or transit of dual-use goods .
2009 discharge ( continuation of debate )
ships that are not up to standard must not be able to escape inspection , regardless of their shipping route and where they are calling in european waters .
your report calls on the commission firstly to take better account of the impact of trade liberalisation and , secondly , not to be limited to the oecd principles in the fight against tax evasion and harmful tax competition .
we welcome the formula of advance payment , because this makes it easier for the beneficiary countries to use the funds .
in writing . - i could not support this amendment because i completely oppose the creation and funding of the eeas and other such programmes reliant on the ratification of the lisbon treaty .
the agenda of the intergovernmental conference was dictated by the enemies of the european constitution , whereas its friends , like yourself , proved to be far too discreet following that famous meeting of the eighteen .
by carrying out this debate and taking the vote today , parliament has practically fulfilled its commitment on these two important matters .
the implementation of the protection of information has been transposed into national legislation , but only time will enable us to judge the efficiency of these provisions , which constitute the cornerstone of good reporting culture by ensuring the necessary trust of the reporters .
( nl ) madam president , no strategy that is , primarily , of a military nature stands any chance of succeeding in afghanistan .
we are the only financial institution that is legally obliged , under the treaty , to financially support the european union 's political objectives .
vice-president of the commission . - mr president , you will not blame me , following this discussion which was not completely clear , for taking the outcome of this discussion home to brussels .
normally , it takes an average of around 18 months to mobilise this fund .
i was voting against it .
as the european parliament , we should therefore be campaigning for the deployment of troops and for humanitarian aid , but we should also be making our contribution as quickly as possible to a sustainable political peace strategy for the region .
reconciliation is almost inconceivable unless a just new order is put in place .
there is huge scope for cooperation in this area .
( sv ) madam president , it is , in many respects , a positive sign that work on the new capital adequacy rules is progressing .
i fully support mr karas ' and mr pitella 's reports in respect of their efforts to ensure that the operation of the banking sector is more effective and accessible to individual customers and small enterprises .
eu cohesion policy is part of a european framework of solidarity encompassing the 27 member states and their 271 regions , and aims to end existing economic and social disparity within the eu .
in paragraph 15 , we want to add the word 'intimidating ' , so that the text reads 'expresses its rejection of the intimidating search of human rights organisations ' .
hence it falls to the union to act in accordance with its values and interests , doing everything it can to close this sordid chapter of our history .
the project 's administration , however , is in a mess .
we firmly believe that progress will be achieved when national management declarations will be received for all the european union 's funds which are subject to shared management .
finally , you must not think ill of me in relation to the fact that for me , as a protestant , the freedom of religion is extraordinarily important .
in writing . - ( ro ) repealing all eight directives will most likely lead to additional administrative burdens as members states will be able to introduce national provisions implementing the measuring instruments covered by the directives being repealed .
last but not least , domestic violence must also be combated in migrant families and the proportion of foreigners in schools limited in order to defuse spiralling violence .
however , on this issue , many products are currently excluded from the scope , and , in our opinion , they should be included as quickly as possible ; this is particularly the case for some types of pension schemes that work via capitalisation , and , more generally , we think that the proposal to include products which guarantee 95 % of the investment does not offer sufficient guarantees .
for this reason , the full implementation of the policy for small and medium-sized enterprises and , in particular , the small business act , is a high priority task for the hungarian presidency .
the airlines have blatantly exploited this in the current situation : the crisis , plus bad winter weather conditions .
however , we still have legislation blocked in the council , such as the legislation on the solidarity fund , and also the legislation on land protection , which we think would be extremely useful .
there is no need for analysis and immersion in documents to be able to state that this region , compared with africa , for instance , is treated as a remote province of our continent .
it is important to act in a global way .
adjournment of the session
we will continue to do so , naturally .
it is estimated that 3.7 million jobs can be created by 2020 , and that annual gross domestic product ( gdp ) can be increased by around eur 800 billion by 2025 .
as regards the amendment on the authorisation of plant protection products which has since been withdrawn , i agree with its content .
after recent developments , we also have to acknowledge that we need a complex solution for all aspects of migration and that we need to consolidate trust in the system .
we also have to take into account consumption patterns , the issue of waste and the complex relationship between the environment , biodiversity and health .
at the same time , it is extremely important to focus on the priorities , and i am glad that the report agrees with the commission on the main priorities , as i said , especially regarding young people , but also pregnant women .
in particular , in consideration of the current financial and economic crisis , we want the same supervisory regulations to apply to the eib as to all other commercial banks , because without real supervisory control , the eib can not be a credible player on the credit market .
( cs ) you asked several questions , each of which needs a complex answer . let me give a simplified answer to the first question : this morning we were debating regulation ( ec ) no 883/2004 which will significantly amend regulation ( eec ) no 1408/71 and which will definitely improve the situation of many people precisely in the area of cross-border contact .
in the last few days it is estimated that about one hundred people have been killed and about two hundred wounded .
i have to offer explicit thanks to mr welle .
add the further contradiction of mrs vlasto , which extends port control to ships anchored offshore .
it is just over a year since the tragedy in haiti , in which more than 200 000 people lost their lives and more than 3 million haitians were affected .
member of the commission . - mr president , the collection of tftp data is important in the fight against terrorism .
an answer to the question of whether the european union counts in the world could be seen in copenhagen .
the report is clearly critical .
as you rightly pointed out , and as highlighted by the united nations food and agriculture organisation , the global aquaculture industry is gaining increasing importance and plays a key role in bridging the gap between a growing demand for seafood and the supply of fish products , especially in a context of diminishing wild fish stocks .
the spanish presidency is of special significance , here , and i am grateful for the presentation of a vision which concurs to a large extent with that of the european parliament .
adopting this own-initiative report compiled by mr harbour will help boost innovation in research and development within the european union .
the third point i want to make is this . the extent of the destruction in haiti was such that we really have to look not just at the damage done , but at why that damage was so extensive .
if we do not buy their energy products , then the russian economy will encounter serious stability problems in the future .
this situation means additional administrative work , with the result that members need qualified staff to act as advisors .
in spite of that , i must say that i was honoured to work with the rapporteur .
from the point of view of a state where agriculture is a relatively large contributor to employment , as is the case in poland , it would be legitimate to raise milk quotas and to provide national support for sectors that are most disadvantaged .
( applause )
in writing . - ( lt ) modern advertising has long overtaken the legal framework of this area .
france , portugal and spain , in particular , certainly do not see only benefits from this geographical fact , as the atlantic plays a not insignificant role when it comes to the streams of refugees that now threaten to increase as a result of the crises in the countries of north africa .
this method is perfect .
it is not just that healthcare financing is precarious , to say the least : doctors and nursing staff are being forced to spend more and more time shackled to their desks , dealing with red tape , instead of performing their actual task of healthcare delivery .
it is time to stop saying : 'let 's put the problem off for a couple of years ' .
mr barroso , i think it makes a good deal of sense for you to ask yourself what the economic and social solutions might be to the problems we have at the moment and the crisis we are experiencing , not taking advantage of the commission 's services but as leader of the group of the european people 's party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats ; i think this is of great importance so that we do not find ourselves in a situation in which the european council wants parliament merely to be consulted ( let us recall the buttiglioni case ) .
provided these essential elements are preserved , in order to take account of the committee 's concerns , the commission could , however , accept the deletion of some of the comitology procedures which , in our opinion , are less essential .
( for the results and other details on the vote , see minutes . )
i support the opinions of the european parliament and its requirement for the member states to exercise real control over the spending of funds from the eu budget and also to provide full and reliable information in this area .
with competition from the new emerging markets ever increasing , it is of the utmost importance to be on top of the situation , and i think that this report expresses this feeling exactly .
therefore , i urge you to respect the choice of the people of ireland in their recent referendum .
moreover , the focus on the europe 2020 strategy , which i support , does lead to cohesion policy , for example , being forgotten .
that is why we abstained .
which of our western governments would agree to watch thousands of missiles fall on its citizens without reacting ?
the main objectives of the process are the reform of the higher education system and the elimination of remaining barriers to the mobility of students and teachers .
very little legal economic migration is truly voluntary .
despite assurances at the highest levels , the perpetrators are rarely brought to justice and sentenced .
it would be completely mistaken and incorrect to characterise this process as a bilateral affair between two member states of the eu .
i am just advising you of the law that applies in this house .
moreover , the treaty of maastricht produced a qualitative leap in european citizenship by offering all citizens the possibility of submitting petitions to a parliamentary body , which remains the sole arbitrator , or applying to a more specialised body which , while operating on an extrajudicial basis , follows a procedure which does not rule out parliamentary intervention in the event of the community institution responsible for the instance of maladministration proving reluctant to cooperate .
when i was in haiti , my impression was that we have actually done quite well - in terms both of the civil protection teams from individual countries and in our own work .
the question was about what can be done if we do not receive a satisfactory response , and one of the possibilities is certainly to repeat the request .
the resolution reminds us that in order to be credible , the european union must not only honour its commitments to provide usd 30 billion of aid to the poorest countries for the period 2010-2012 , but also show imagination in order to save the planet .
this is that we are coming up with a proposed solution well ahead of time , creating conditions for modernity .
in writing . - ( ro ) the crowning moment of the bali conference was the adoption of a roadmap for a secure climate future , which is a new negotiation process due for completion in 2009 , leading to the resumption of negotiations concerning global warming after 2012 , when the first stage of the kyoto protocol ends .
it is clear that the european union will only attain the ambitious targets in its climate policy if it succeeds in ensuring broad use of ccs ( carbon capture and storage ) technologies in power stations .
i would like to mention that , as shadow rapporteur for the group of the european people 's party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats , i am pleased with the unanimous adoption by all the political groups in parliament of the requirement stipulated for member states ' compulsory participation in the new system , which guarantees the importance of this initiative from a european perspective .
in order to be able to start work on the budget in 2010 , we therefore need a number of transitional provisions .
included in this are personal data on family and sex life , housing situation and religious affiliation .
as far as i am concerned , economic interests are entirely secondary to these two key concepts .
the report was unanimously approved in the committee on women 's rights .
there are now delays not only in sis , but also in the visa information system ( vis ) , as both projects are being developed by the same company .
this motion for a resolution is a step in this direction , calling on the commission and the council , along with the european parliament , to involve national parliaments , social partners and regional and local authorities in policies designed to restore jobs and growth .
the horrors and crimes that are the legacy of these regimes must never be forgotten : i therefore welcome this discussion on the past .
the prime minister of the spanish government had the courtesy to come and present to us here spain 's priorities for a six-month term of the spanish presidency .
if we only look at the issue of public finance , for example , two or three years ago , the commission and its departments were themselves saying that , of all the countries , spain was sticking to the stability and growth pact most closely and that spain 's public finances were in order .
that is why it is important that the council and the commission undertake a careful analysis of this issue .
i have to say that the slowness of the eu institutions in addressing the mediterranean question can only be explained by a lack of awareness of the situation and an inability to sense the changes that are afoot .
circumstances however , have forced me to express my opinion on a particularly serious matter , the proclamation of independence of kosovo by albanian separatists .
irrationally enough , the chinese government does not take hold of this helping hand , but strikes it down repressively .
the people of cuba do not enjoy freedom of speech and assembly .
we and the rest of the world have signed up to the un convention on the rights of the child .
i would particularly like to know who can trigger them and when .
we need to be better informed about the origin marking of the products we purchase .
moreover , no reference is made to the initiative of the bolivian president evo morales ayma 's people 's world conference on climate change .
this is the only way in which we will be able to continue to promote the respect of the fundamental principles established by the european convention for human rights and supplemented by the charter of fundamental rights , including by consolidating our own mechanisms for this purpose .
mrs ayala sender , i would like to begin by congratulating you for making one of the most tragic social problems our common political priority .
indeed , the right approach is the one also stressed by the council conclusions , which is to reaffirm the further development of bilateral relations with israel .
in addition , this has nothing at all to do with the european union .
i would also like to take this opportunity to make an appeal on behalf of patients , who become the focus of our treatment and should become the focus of our care : they should have better access to new scientific knowledge and new information .
only this helps us effectively stand against any future crisis .
in actual fact they have come to an agreement and they have sorted it out themselves , yet you have not dropped the anti-dumping legislation against that particular company .
that is to say , it wants to be able to block any decision that is directed towards spending one euro more than planned , no matter what happens .
finally , mr president , i can see that time is running out , i fully agree that in a sense , low qualifications cost more than the crisis .
in these difficult economic times , it is very important that workers are able to earn overtime if they want to and that employers also have flexibility .
in writing . - i voted in favour of this important resolution because it is high time to pay attention to chemical , biological , radiological and nuclear ( cbrn ) risks which present a new dimension of possible terrorist attacks , accidents , natural disasters and/or pandemics due to their transnational character and mass-scale victimisation .

with regard to the reserved terms 'mountain ' , 'island ' and so forth , we are looking into the possibility of introducing these kinds of systems .
my thanks go to the german chancellor , angela merkel , for expressing herself clearly on zimbabwe on behalf of all of us .
very well , i think we are happy to oblige ; but then , in return , i think this parliament would like to be more closely involved in matters such as , for example , the framework for transatlantic data protection , because for the last year and a half that has been treated by civil servants behind closed doors , as if it were a mere technical matter rather than one relating to our civil liberties and our fundamental rights .
what is the answer , in my view ?
that being the case , we should continue with question time until a decision has been taken , rather than pre-emptively acquiescing to a decision that has not yet been made .
for me , it is indeed worrying that , although the european parliament approved the ombudsman 's code of good administrative behaviour in 2001 with its own resolution , the other institutions of the union have not fully followed the requests made by parliament .
so we need to tread very warily indeed here , because it is currently impossible to ensure the application of certain common basic standards in the law of criminal procedure .
the second consideration on which i based my report is that , as may be seen from the report on the implementation of the hague programme for 2007 , the level of implementation with regard to legal cooperation in the criminal field was somewhat low , even though satisfactory developments were registered in other sectors , such as civil co-operation , border management , immigration and asylum policies .
on agriculture , as i said , it is critically important to make sure that we are able to develop our industries .
some time ago , the symbols of the union collapsed when the proposal for the so-called european constitution was rejected .
it would be a paradox if the european parliament were to become so heavily and effectively involved in combating manifestations of discrimination in the world yet were unable to cope with respect for human rights at home - that is , in the eu member states .
but to add to the country 's grave state of affairs came the involvement of the so-called islamic courts .
the external service must be wholly in step with the commission .
we must emphasise that human rights and basic freedoms must be respected as a way of preventing ethnic or cultural conflicts .
in this context , the commission welcomes your support in urging member states to stay committed to achieving by 2015 the 0.7 % oda/gni target .
perhaps that explains why there are so few women on supervisory boards ?
in writing . - i consider this report another positive step forward in assisting pedestrians in the eu from the many injuries and fatalities caused by motor vehicle accidents .
i am voting against this report .
it was a step in the right direction when the new president of lithuania asked the lithuanian parliament to reconsider the law to ensure that it complies with the constitutional principles of the rule of law , legal certainty , and legal clarity and that it does not contravene the guarantees of an open society and pluralistic democracy .
in the medium to long term , trade relations should be intensified in accordance with clear and transparent rules .
unfortunately , as the report shows , we still have a great deal to do as regards equal opportunities .
the report by mrs von thun is a very successful example of how we , as the european parliament , can show that we are serious about actually implementing what we have decided on together with the council , and this implementation is the job of the member states .
at a time when major democratic changes are taking place , i believe that european citizens should be involved alongside their heads of states in the decisions europe takes in relation to these major issues .
member of the commission . - ( cs ) madam president , ladies and gentlemen , council directive 1999/70/ec concerning the framework agreement on fixed-term work requires the member states to adopt such measures that would prevent abuse arising from the use of successive fixed-term employment contracts .
on the committee on the environment , public health and food safety we have of course had a disagreement about this , and i call on all members on the left to just set ideology aside this time and ensure that we adopt a good directive for patients and take a pragmatic approach .
however , the enhanced supervision of rating agencies should not be limited to the eu level alone .
what are we greek politicians and the greek people asking for ?
we stand by the office .
to this end the eu should support a global partnership for agriculture and food in accordance with the eu 's action plan for the millennium goals .
that is new , i think .
you should accept that one of the reasons that the commission puts forward so many ill-considered , ill-thought out , inappropriate and ill-drafted proposals , which we in england and other countries have to put up with , is the lack of transparency .
this dimension of the problem is referred to in the report but only in passing .
incidentally , mr danilishin has never been a member of any political party , so the charge brought against him is entirely economic in nature .
by this , i mean that europe needs to call somebody to account .
there are more and more indications that people traffickers are turning to these orphans in their search for sex slaves for brothels the world over .
the court found in spain 's favour and annulled the new support scheme for cotton .
in this respect , the e-commerce directive can be reviewed separately from the review of the consumer acquis , and i assure you that i will follow this subject very closely with fellow commissioner mccreevy , within whose portfolio lies the e-commerce directive .
the objective of the funding mechanism is to consist , and i quote , of 'incentives for the fastest possible return by the financial market to setting high-risk prices ' .
mr president , as i listened to the president of the european council , i heard a different tone to that of the president of the commission .
the legal commotion surrounding google has shown the consequences of the lack of uniform copyright law in the european union as well as the impossibility of giving a unified response to the google books initiative .
( pl ) mr president , first and foremost i should like to thank mr borloo for his excellent preparation for the negotiations on the climate package and for steering them through to their conclusion .
today , the eu is latin america 's second-largest trading partner and the biggest investor in the region .
but i can well understand her reasons for doing so .
also the age under which the children are exempted from the obligation to provide fingerprints raises many questions , as we have heard .
these banks have a positive impact in delivering aid to developing countries , but i believe that this impact needs to be properly assessed .
excellent cooperation from my colleagues , mr becsey and mr rosati , led me to realise that , if we were to get a report through at all , i had to adjust the level without the purpose of my original proposals being entirely frustrated .
opening of the sitting
very differently from europe .
i admire very much your commitment and , could i say , perseverance .
fisheries in west african waters are close to being exhausted , trade in illegal timber is destroying the environment , and the exploitation of other natural resources has proved to have huge consequences in a poor and politically unstable region .
our party , the socialist party in the netherlands , sees parties as grass-roots organisations , popular movements that work together to achieve their vision of how society ought to be and in pursuit of the interests of the groups that place their trust in a given party .
it states that the scope of the recommendation is inadequate and that it does not include many important activities such as natura 2000 and the control of illegal waste shipping .
we should have expected you to say that , in the wake of lisbon , there will be a new construct in 2010 , a new strategy which will focus sharply on protection of the european social model and which will reorder our priorities once more .
on behalf of the ind/dem group . - madam president , it comes as no surprise to hear baroness ludford of the euro-fanatic liberal democrat party wanting to harmonise yet another area of what should be sovereign national policy .
the committee of demanders of women 's right to drive cars was set up in riyadh on 27 september .
this parliament has repeatedly called on the member states to devote far greater urgency to addressing the auditors ' concerns , and in particular , we have called on the member states to meet the terms of the 2006 interinstitutional agreement .
today was about reviewing the situation on the ground and assessing the consequences for relations between the european union and russia .
the request for a 5 % increase in the next budget is therefore just and necessary .
this is why we in the group of the greens/european free alliance are of the opinion that checks on large projects must be increased , rather than reduced as specified in this proposal .
the european union 's symbols - flag , anthem and motto - no longer exist as such from a legal point of view since two european nations broadly rejected the european constitution in 2005 .
it needs to be stated quite clearly that , in its present form , the common agricultural policy is leading to a loss of biological security in the european union and a deepening of the global food crisis .
that must imply an offer of practical assistance .
that is all very good in theory , but in practice i certainly did not see this happen in mumbai .
toxic , hazardous substances are used in many industrial processes other than mining .
while gdp must remain the main criterion , the commission should also look at other indicators that might better account for regional difficulties .
i must admit that i do not fully understand your remark , mr leichtfried , because the members have reacted very well .
i am not happy that we ended up with an increase of 2.3 % .
thank you , mr president .
he wrote about the fall of the 'berlin wall of climate change ' .
it is a debate that i have found to be very interesting and extremely rich in terms of contributions , and it also has new , important dimensions that were not part of the lisbon strategy or did not have the same emphasis in it .
i do not agree with the person who told the banks to do less or to be more prudent at this difficult time .
not doing this may lead to another lost decade , a lasting halt to growth and mass unemployment .
it may justifiably be argued that the eu is the wrong forum to solve the type of problem highlighted in this report .
we hope that this is a step forward .
it is true that institutions that govern complex and broad areas , as the european parliament does , often can not avoid the temptation to surround their own democratic power with red tape .
( the speaker agreed to take a blue card question under rule 149 ( 8 ) )
i am mainly concerned about the pensions of those young people who work in the different countries , the different member states of the european union .

this indicates that my country had a suitable vision and will make a significant contribution to implementing the defence system .
the oral question to the commission by nikolaos chountis and jürgen klute , on behalf of the gue/ngl group , on credit rating agencies - b7-0302/2010 ) ,
on the question of labelling in general , let me say that i think that falls short of what we need .
the road transport sector is the second highest emitter of greenhouse gases within the union and its emissions , including those from light commercial vehicles , are continuing to increase .
given that this question of controlling external borders concerns the powers of frontex , the commission has obtained a detailed response from the agency , which is attached .
mexico is also making a very serious effort to respond to the concerns over human rights abuses , in particular the impact of organised crime groups and vested interests of freedom of the media and freedom of expression , which have been brought to the attention of the eu by civil society organisations .
this commitment should not be open-ended either in terms of time or financial resources .

it is nothing to do with abortion in poland or ireland .
i think that a much better description than 'made in china ' , which it would probably receive under this regulation , would be 'made in the world ' , to quote pascal lamy , former commissioner and current director-general of the wto .
it is now time to make it a more attractive , effective and credible policy that guarantees security and prosperity for all .
let us be clear , mr president , ladies and gentlemen : in the rest of the world , socio-economic strategies are already being implemented for the medium term .
dialogue should therefore resume both between israelis and palestinians and among palestinians .
it can be said that progress in the first area - concerning security - will have a beneficial effect on the conditions under which people live , while progress in the second area - concerning an improvement in the conditions under which people live - will foster an improvement in security .
we all want to work together to refine , reduce and replace animal testing .
one is a toy seal ; one is an electric kettle .
i voted for this report .
just think of darfur , somalia and , let us not forget , the congo .
regrettably there are many potential flashpoints , and russian interference is considerable .
but perhaps the most important lesson learned from the peace programme is the effectiveness of the bottom-up approach .
that would not be reasonable , it would not be responsible and it would not be worthy of a self-respecting statesman .
as people work very hard to save for holidays , we must make them feel secure .
as part of community energy policy , the commission and the member states should identify investments which are necessary to meet the eu 's strategic needs in terms of the supply and demand of natural gas and electricity .
what does a redundant worker want ?
it seems that it was because of article 290 and delegated acts - something which is in the treaty of lisbon .
at the same time , each member state decides whether or not to use nuclear energy .
the naked truth is that we are in retreat and in defensive mode in the southern neighbourhood and the eastern neighbourhood .
i supported this resolution .
thanks to this , we in parliament can be closer to our citizens , which will strengthen our democracy .
we do not have a cooperation and trade agreement on which to hang a democratic clause , we have not managed to send an electoral observation mission , and the funds of the instrument for democracy and human rights are minute .
if i plant a grain of corn , i am thinking only of today , but if i plant a tree , i am looking to the future .
however , we consider that fixing a date for the end of the transitional period is premature at this stage and could create an obstacle to the necessary quick adoption of the amending proposal by the council .
some , i think , can be withdrawn since they actually overlap with the texts already adopted by the main committee .
i believe that what you have presented here is an approach that brings genuine reason for hope .
thank you mrs ţicău , we take due note of your observation .
firstly , energy security and climate change .
i believe that what is least helpful in the dispute over the situation in , and the prospects for , greece is an anti-greek , nationalistic or anti-european attitude .
in fact , accelerating the nabucco project is vital .
this started this morning at 08.00 , through eurocontrol .
it is crucial to strengthen the urban dimension of cohesion policy and to promote sustainable urban development , particularly by strengthening and developing instruments to implement the leipzig charter at all levels .
secondly , as has been mentioned here today , a gap is opening up between what we say and what we do , in other words , a gap between the eu 's internal and external responses .
( uproar )
we can only support this view , and i would congratulate you , prime minister , on the clear and determined position you have taken vis-à-vis the belarusian regime , europe 's last remaining dictatorship .
this is particularly the case when it comes to personal data .
i would therefore also like to make it clear at the outset that it was not easy to find a common line within our group .
( fr ) madam president , as far as solvency ii is concerned , that is a reform that was launched well before the crisis and that the latter has shed new light on .
this will facilitate education in the area of information technology , as well as making it easier to obtain information , especially for people who live in rural areas .
nor indeed do i deny that commissioner špidla has struggled hard in a hostile environment to get this package approved .
i would like to state that this question is on the european political agenda because the commission has just addressed the matter in a number of its documents and also in view of the fact that the commission is drawing up a specific potential revision of current laws , and of course also because parliament has taken up the topic thanks to the report of mrs bauer , for which i would once again like to express my appreciation .
in writing . - ( fi ) mr president , mr rack 's report on a new culture of urban mobility , in favour of which we have voted , is an important part of the new comprehensive approach of the commission 's energy and climate package : significant reductions in emissions can be achieved in europe using sensible , efficient community and transport planning .
the recent gas crisis highlighted the need for us to adopt a serious and united approach to dealing with the issue of the european union 's dependency on its resource suppliers .
they need to have their interest stimulated in the many ways of preparing regional produce .
they were protesting against the unfair and discriminatory action taken by the commission against the polish fishing industry .
it is not up to the council to decide exactly the age this should happen , but rather to encourage all member states to make full use of their labour force .
we are in complete agreement with you , commissioner , that this consolidates , and at the same time reduces the number of , the regulations relating to the transport of dangerous goods .
first , concerning the lisbon treaty : as you know , the commission is fully committed to this new lisbon treaty ; we are fully committed to its implementation , and we are preparing - not anticipating , but preparing - to be ready for implementation as from early next year .
i believe that we have reached a good compromise , as mrs grossetête has said .
attendance at our institutions of higher education would be an excellent opportunity for students from those countries to develop according to western standards .
it is obvious that this kind of conflict can not be solved by armed force .
i myself investigated the reception of chechen refugees in poland , because a number of chechen refugees were sent back to poland from belgium on the basis of dublin .
in writing . - i have voted against at the final vote of this report because it included the promotion of governmental interference with internet governance , which is not exactly the green position .
the body scanner is the last frontier in this modern torture , as stefano rodotà describes it .
students from all backgrounds should have the opportunity to benefit from the wealth of cultural and intellectual opportunities the eu offers .
mr president , i support in principle the idea of a european competitiveness pact , making provision for harmonisation of the retirement age and , especially , speeding up the mutual recognition of academic and professional qualifications , as well as better coordinating research and development efforts .
quite frankly , in the socialist split , i would choose mr schulz , with no regrets and no remorse .
the draft bill also goes against the united nations declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity .
the main drawback is the necessary mobilisation of the fund .
finally , the european union must fully uphold the action required with regard to combating illegal drug importation , people trafficking and in particular the diminution of respect for individual human lives .
we are proud to stand strong and united with our shadow rapporteur , mr le foll .
part 1 of the act discusses the commission 's plans for introducing an environment which encourages entrepreneurship .
it has been deformed in the course of its history by various compromises based on gradual concessions , predominantly to large member states .
mr president , although there is much good in this report , there is something i totally disagree with , as my colleagues , mr kaczmarek and mr mitchell have already done .
the present compromise safeguards the independence of the experts who decide if a ship in danger is to be given refuge , fair treatment for seamen in the event of an accident in accordance with the ιμο , the obligation of uninsured ships in refuges , compensation for ports and refuges for damage , on which the commission will present various policy options , and the obligation of oil tanker owners to notify their cargo if it exceeds 1 000 tonnes .
although i understand the historical and political circumstances of belarus , i firmly believe that the time has also come for belarus to join the ranks of those countries that have outlawed the death penalty .
it is a very serious allegation .
we are living in the 21st century and crimes of opinion and conscience should be erased from the values of every state in the world , no matter how long its history of totalitarianism and dictatorship might be .
in poznań and copenhagen we shall have to take the lead again .
finally , their funding will be more transparent , which can only increase their legitimacy , and i welcome this .
that must be made quite clear .
a number of things have clearly improved : kurdish television , but also the installation of a women 's committee in the turkish parliament , for which i , as rapporteur on women 's rights in turkey , worked extremely hard in recent years .
we expect from the commission a clear allocation of the responsibilities for this matter and effective coordination between all relevant services .
that will continue to be the case .
that is why we have voted against .
this is being introduced at a time when businesses are currently in the situation where they pay vat on an invoice as soon as it is issued , but the relevant invoice payment ( and associated vat ) may only be paid months later , if ever .
i absolutely agree with that .
a more consistent policy would result from this .
in fact , flouting our own rules of procedure to such an extent is to sow the seeds of latent totalitarianism .
to deal with the markets ' irrational exuberance , the revision of the treaty ought to have been an opportunity to authorise the european central bank to do what the united states does and buy back public debt in the event of exchange rate tensions .
it is my fervent hope that the commission will continue to take seriously its task of introducing the internal control framework in future .
this cat-and-mouse game is over .
it is probable that this did not happen due to a lack of awareness of some of the key problems faced by the sector .
the truth is , the supervisory authorities are national authorities .
the clear answer is yes , and , as you well know , on this we shall all be judged not by our aspirations at the outset , our initial ambitions , but purely by what we have achieved .
it must be ensured , however , that the financial and administrative burden on farmers is not increased because of any increased surveillance and monitoring of antimicrobial resistance ( amr ) in food producing and companion animals .
as a result , i am pleased to say that the implementation of the package of post-conflict assistance prepared by the european commission with support from member states and other parties is working well .
( de ) madam president , mr oettinger , ladies and gentlemen , funding has been available , which should have been invested in the energy sector , among other areas .
thank you , mrs wortmann-kool , for your explanation .
this would seem fair , given that this sector has benefited from enormous amounts of state aid in order to survive the unprecedented crisis that it itself caused .
the debate is closed .
unbundling of ownership does not by any means guarantee a reduction in consumer prices .
it will also be done by providing adequate assistance to the regions and towns of the mediterranean coast that will have to deal with the humanitarian emergency that this influx of immigrants is going to create , and that will have to ensure that order is maintained and to encourage the integration of legal migrants .
at the same time , cooperation and dialogue between the pan-african parliament and this house will be extended and these institutions will also act as channels for the implementation of the joint strategy and action plan .
( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to dedicate this international day for the elimination of violence against women to the memory of anna politkovskaya , a journalist and a woman who paid for her love of truth with her life , to the african women in conflicts , and to the many forms of suffering of women in europe that often go unobserved .
a lot of people , tens of thousands of them , are stranded all over the world and waiting to come home .
this has put people 's lives at risk , for example where someone is forced to flee from their home country on account of political oppression .
are we following an intelligent , integrated strategy in aiming to combat the causes of terrorism ?
the debate is closed .
attacks on workers ' salaries and rights , the dismantling and degrading of public services , the attack on the state 's social functions and cuts in public investment are integral parts of the economic and monetary policies that the european union has been imposing on member states .
this is a truly grotesque undertaking .
