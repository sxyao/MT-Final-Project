i would say to mr posselt that consolidating peace , to give people the confidence that it is irreversible , is most important right now .
the debate is closed .
it offers a number of starting points for our work , which consists of making europe better and more efficient every day .
in writing . - the issue voted on refers to issues of regulation of media ownership .
thank you very much , mr swoboda .
i remember when , at the age of about 21 , i worked as part of the crew of a ship which travelled between new york and the bahamas : whenever i left the ship and ventured into new york city i was allowed to take two bottles of whisky with me , which , as i boarded the bus , would regularly be bought from me at three times the price , for whisky was much more expensive in new york .
you are turning the thing on its head , and you know what you are doing .
the debate at the time was about whether intervention should take place immediately , after one or two weeks or after six weeks .
earlier this month , i presented the committee with two special reports .
teachers , most of whom are women , do not enjoy the corresponding level of social recognition , status and , above all , remuneration .
indeed , we think that the information society should be both respectful of citizens ' rights and positive from an economic and social point of view , opening up a new cultural sphere .
( the sitting was opened at 3.55 p.m . )
i would also like to add that european citizens have the right to understand the mechanisms governing this membership , just as they have the right to know what their rights are .
having given up on soya at the blair house negotiations , he will be successful at the wto negotiations and next on the list will be the farmers .
those who do not fight are our partners .
mrs jensen has done an excellent job and i should like to congratulate her again .
i think that we should take action on this .
my group has of course discussed the effects that these publications and figures have had .
that concludes this item .
the third point is mobility .
and when that happens , flexibility will not be a positive alternative , but an excuse and a weakness which will destroy the union .
we need concrete proposals and we do not need a purely sectoral approach .
i also welcome that the european union has raised the issue of anti-missile technology for discussion .
our objective should be for the ideas produced by the best minds to eventually bring us a result at which the citizens of europe will rejoice .
another concern that might well have motivated him is : would anybody have turned up out of lack of interest ?
i think it is fair to say that some very important structural decisions were made for the sake of greater financial stability in the euro area and greater economic coordination .
- ( pl ) mr president , robert gwiazdowski , an expert at the adam smith institute , is on record as having written that monty kaczyński 's flying circus had flown back from brussels but that it was not at all clear why it had flown there in the first place .
one thing that russia must bear in mind is that the energy reserves - the gas reserves in particular - are running out ; they will not be exhausted today , but they will be in eight or ten years ' time , perhaps lasting as long as twelve , and the question arises of what russia will do then .
such an agreement should serve the development of our societies and of employment and not give rise to uncontrolled liberalisation that would have disastrous effects .
the commission 's approach to guarantees is therefore closer to the spirit of mr peijs ' amendments nos 4 and 5 , which specifically aim to ensure a more standard approach to the implementation of guarantee provisions .
in my country , antidrugs discos , as they are called , are now part of the scene .
the member states must take all the requisite steps to protect and safeguard cultural heritage . this is especially true of their historic city centres , which occasionally suffer from the additional pressures of increasing urbanisation .
i would therefore like to ask you to reassure me , if possible , that this law will not put oil processing companies that process russian petrol at a disadvantage , and will consequently not put central and eastern european member states in a discriminative situation .
i can assure the house that our efforts will be very much in that direction .
national financing , in whatever proportion , will call a body 's credibility into question and will open the door to administrative and legal uncertainty .
i think that basic compassion , mr president , demands that my honourable friend 's request be accepted .
against this background , concern has been expressed recently following information published last month by the department of homeland security on the so-called automated targeting system .
this right is , and i quote : 'becoming an integral part of the legal heritage of every citizen of the european union ' , according to the commission .
. mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i am glad that this debate on the future of the european union is happening today , for the future is always about money and where it is invested , and i believe that we are going the right way about investing in the lisbon agenda , having allocated eur 92 million to preparatory measures and pilot projects , and eur 49 million to the financial environment , concentrating on the economic divide in the border regions .
they are being blocked by the israelis , and we must place the blame appropriately .
may i nonetheless voice a point of criticism : on a decision of such gravity , the fact that the schengen information system is functioning properly is by no means enough .
in the digital age in which we live , the effective safeguarding of copyright and related rights is exceptionally important in order to limit piracy and ensure that royalties are paid to right-holders .
the commission is also proposing that firms which infringe these regulations be obliged to return the aid they have received and that they be barred from receiving any aid in the future .
the parmalat fraud is especially relevant as it concerns bondholders : precisely the section of the market that rating agencies are supposed to protect .
the greek presidency has endeavoured to begin this work , but we have a long , long way to go .
in order to ensure that european consumers can have total confidence in their beef supply , will the council not consider imposing an immediate ban on the export of beef from brazil to the european union rather than waiting until the end of this year ?
we should also ask ourselves about the status of sexuality in this information society , because if there is a supply to be eliminated , that is because there is a demand .
therefore , we believe that guidelines for passenger safety should be included in the regulations ( amendments 15-16 ) .
if the eu wishes to have influence , the eu member states must cooperate .
however , as we say in portugal , there is always a `` but ' and here it lies in the fact that , on the subject of tobacco , this report echoes others in adopting only a partial approach to the problem .
it may also be our duty to do our utmost to make this tool effective , in the conviction that future administrations of our us friends may possibly take a different attitude and themselves take advantage of the major tool we are offering them .
that is the simple message of the olympic truce : the olympic truce is not a magic wand for resolving wars ; it is a window of opportunity .
according to the commission , such a tax base would be used to promote the lisbon strategy to a significant extent , because it will help to make the internal market more effective , which would lead to an improved eu competitive position in global markets .
moreover , what is the commission doing to ensure that prior to having the economy in place in turkey , and before making any other demands , that first and foremost , attention is paid to fundamental human rights ?
the first aspect is solidarity .
we did so because we felt that , in spite of everything , the result was not good enough .
we have already asked the efsa to re-evaluate all their authorised additives , and if the efsa 's opinion indicates that direction we will not be hesitant in applying new rules regarding these additives .
that is one positive feature of this report .
there are no major differences dividing political groups .
the ecb , then , is required to show the realism and pragmatism recognised as essential by its president-elect if the economic system based on the single currency and the common monetary policy , which was constructed so laboriously and with such difficulty , is not to be threatened with collapse .
it is important that the european institutions that are directly accountable to the electorate - in other words , parliament and the council of ministers - should continue to have - and be seen to have - the final decision-making authority on issues of importance to our citizens .
the dialogue between the commission , on the one hand , and the council and parliament , on the other , which was initiated on the basis of the commission communication on annual policy strategy , makes it possible for these two institutions to ensure that their point of view on the proposals put forward by the community executive for the following year is taken into account , before the final version of the legislative and work programme is drawn up .
i did not therefore vote for assent concerning the accession treaty for 10 new member states to the union .
i am talking about the strengthening of parliaments ( both the european parliament and national parliaments ) .
mr president , we have listened with great interest to mr solana’s speech , particularly the first part in which he listed what had happened over the course of january .
the eu will maintain its support for the opposition .
i would finally like to draw the attention of this house to one issue : the recent news that united states troops have used white phosphorous in the streets of fallujah .
in this case , i feel that the crisis in campania offers an important lesson on waste management to all europeans , including lithuanians .
at this time - unfortunately , it might be said - a book is coming out in denmark which deals with the estonia accident .
another was apparently free of echinacea root altogether , and the last had not been solely manufactured from echinacea root powder as claimed on the label .
it is true that we need greater security – as you have quite rightly said – in order to guarantee freedom , but that guarantee must not take the form currently employed by the united states government , which identifies security with a reduction in freedom .
the commission could show some flexibility vis-à-vis its original proposal of a eur 4.5 million budget , but certainly not on such a drastic cut .
i hope that a large proportion of the counterfeit goods will be stopped and seized prior to their export from china .
we have done some good work over the last few years .
at the same time , we will also create new markets and new jobs and will have the 'first mover ' advantage in many of those sectors .
if the official who has been constantly gesturing to me that i am not entitled to put a second supplementary question has this point checked by the competent authorities , he will find that i am indeed entitled to do so under the current rules of procedure , subject to your consent pursuant to point 6 ( a ) of annex ii .
intermodality is absolutely essential if we want to make our transport systems more effective and efficient .
there has been a lot of disinformation and i am sorry that someone wrongly briefed the president of bolivia who wrote in the british newspaper the guardian yesterday .
consumer confidence in banks is of paramount importance .
where has the gbp 75 billion gone ?
i also regret that parliament has still not been able to come up with a response to the green paper , but that has quite a lot to do with shortcomings in the way in which parliament is structured when it comes to dealing with consumer issues .
i support the various arrangements the rapporteur has mentioned , including the amendments asking for full information rather than just adequate information to be given to passengers and others .
we have a moral and ethical duty to ensure we are prepared for such missions in future with the likes of the rapid reaction force .
we call for the immediate release of political prisoners and for the direct return of political exiles .
serbia , in a similar way to all countries on the balkan peninsula , is a very specific case .
this does not strengthen interest in european affairs , nor does it bring members of parliament closer to the people .
whatever the difficulties in our relations with that great country , there are gestures which need to be made in order to iron out regrettable mistakes .
it is susceptible to fraud and , unlike the on-board computer , can not be used to improve operations .
in this context , the european union supports the efforts of the african union for a peaceful solution to the conflict .
is massive opposition to cofinancing in the interests of the sector in the long term ?
on this subject , i believe we must reconsider using the codecision procedure and majority decision-making with regard to employment policy .
on behalf of the pse group . - ( fr ) madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i first wish to thank and congratulate mr mulder for his work , and also for his methodology and the various consultations he carried out .
i shall enquire at the services into the exact course of events .
the committee has serious doubts about the safety of stevioside and does not consider it acceptable for use in food .
i am sure you would want to report as a matter of some urgency .
it is , to put it bluntly , immoral , and i quite simply do not understand those member states who can not appreciate this .
turkey plays a key role in energy security and in the dialogue between civilisations .
amongst other things , it is proposed to introduce a deterrent tariff and to revise the rates of duty if quantities are imported which exceed the established quota , which it is proposed should be reduced .
common sense also obliges me to consider the modest role that the european union plays in this .
we object to wordings inserted into the text as contributions concerning the eu’s future and method of working .
i am of the opinion , however , that with the rapporteur we have found acceptable solutions to this problem .
but that should not prevent parliament from allowing ethical sense to prevail .
the socialist group in the european parliament , as far as i know , has only 18 minutes to speak .
it aims to support economic , financial and technical cooperation , as well as academic and research exchanges .
the union must continue to press the palestinian authority to take concrete steps to arrest and bring to justice those who commit terrorist acts .
mr president , everyone accepts that enlargement is a historic challenge and a historic step .
in other words , electromobility is on the way , but , whatever efficiencies we may achieve , oil will remain essential in the decades ahead if one accepts current individual mobility patterns and if one has an interest in car production .
we need an economic and developmental approach and we need to offer yemen the kind of assistance that will help it build its state and administrative capacities .
as regards the alber report , we have already briefed the house in our half-yearly report .
the eu has to ensure that member states not only expect the eu itself to observe the principle of subsidiarity , but that they , too , ensure that decision making takes place as close to the citizens as possible .
in order to implement the package proposed in the communication , the commission will opt for an approach by stages that is intended to reinforce the framework for cooperation between the european union and the neighbouring countries .
apart from the legally unusual construction of article 3 in conjunction with article 5 , the main problem is , in my opinion , that errors occur for a wide variety of reasons in proceedings abroad , particularly in the investigation of the circumstances , and remain unchallenged , again for a wide variety of reasons .
the commission reports on which this debate is based presuppose that there are to be no major changes this year , because a large-scale evaluation of the first five-year period is to be carried out in the course of next year .
in this respect , the community must prove its strength .
naturally , there is a great deal of apprehension in this context , and it is important for the commission and the european union as a whole to affirm that this modernization process will , as far as possible , be carried out with the agreement of and not in opposition to the workforce in the establishments concerned .
as the author is not present , question no 2 lapses .
such a european cultural policy could well help to bring together the needs of the cultural world and those of the public , thereby addressing the soul of europe as nothing else can , and with it , people’s hearts , for it is with their hearts , more than with their minds , that people will be prepared to vote ‘yes’ in a referendum .
that is a great innovative project .
madam president , commissioner lewandowski , mr espadas moncalvillo , i am disappointed both by today 's reply from the spanish president-in-office of the council and that of commissioner lewandowski .
we would like to see a european council devoted entirely to the issue of space .
not everything is hunky-dory in eu-russia relations , of course .
in this european context , more stringent liability is not feasible for manufacturers .
the amendment simply reiterates parliament 's view that all third-country aircraft landing at community airports and suspected of not complying with international air safety standards should be subject to ramp inspections .
i know very well that the phare and tacis people are concerned about what i am now saying . but the time has come to set up a real baltic sea programme , in which we coordinate things in an entirely different way .
ladies and gentlemen , the european union is a europe of solidarity and it is also the advocate for the european regions .
i should like to call for this study to be completed promptly , so that the results can be made available as soon as possible and we can adopt legislation that takes these results into account .
this means greener growth : building a competitive and sustainable economy , tackling climate change , accelerating the roll-out of smart grids and genuine eu-scale networks , modernising the eu 's industrial base , and turning the european union into a resource efficient economy .
for this reason the belarusian government must , in future , take steps to guarantee truly democratic elections in keeping with the provisions of international law .
the regime in power in the country is regarded throughout europe as a hard-line dictatorship .
in the case of roma people , meanwhile , the disadvantages they face as a result of a low educational level and generations of unemployment are multiplied several times over .
we facilitate democratic elections in palestine , yet we question the people’s voice when we hear it .
viewed as a whole , this process , which incorporates both the gdp shares and the population-based shares , constitutes a practical and equitable way of allocating the shares .
indeed it is fitting that earlier today we congratulated betty williams , mairead corrigan , david trimble and john hume , all nobel prize winners , for their contribution to peace-building and peacemaking in northern ireland .
i want above all to emphasise that the preliminary draft budget is , with eur 4.7 billion , below the amount that the agenda 2000 financial perspective fixed as a maximum .
for example , the report accepts the export of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste to third countries , something with which we disagree radically .
the popular and social europe , cohesion and the charter of fundamental rights are not under spanish copyright but they have been heavily influenced by spain and of this we can feel legitimately proud .
these men paid with their lives for their commitment to democracy .
very often , such projects are combined projects which , apart from waste-water- and rainwater-related infrastructure , may also include water supply infrastructure .
this clearly does not apply in the present case .
. mr president , this report on the protection of minorities and anti-discrimination policies in an enlarged european union is an extremely wide report .
thanks to the work of the rapporteurs , simplification has been brought to the process and particularly welcome is the idea that a seven-member panel from seven different countries would initiate the process .
the member states are happy .
it also gives us the opportunity to operate quite effectively as an international community .
i would like to ask what support you have in mind for small agricultural producers , especially in the new member states .
of course , at this stage , the council is still busy examining the issue , and conclusions are being prepared for our competitiveness council on 26 november .
frode jakobsen subsequently became leader of the successful underground government , the danish freedom association .
let us not miss this opportunity !
that concludes question time .
i am surprised that they continue to charge supplements to single people who sometimes simply find it difficult to afford this .
the easiest way for them to cover up this crime is to set up forest fires , and every summer thousands of hectares of bulgarian forests are set on fire and burnt .
the report quite rightly reminds us that progress in partnership and above all in the attainment of goals is only achieved to any significant degree on the basis of careful analysis .
unfortunately , we have not received any institutional reply to this question so far .
the amendments tabled by mrs angelilli were justified .
but it is obvious that we need to cooperate .
mr president , action against terrorism has eroded human rights and is eroding the protection of ordinary citizens’ privacy in europe and outside it .
the ais is also there for the benefit of fishing vessels , improving safety for these vessels , too .
thus , chaos rules everywhere , and everyone is confused .
i have always regarded it as a privilege and one which demands absolute integrity .
the agreements i am telling you about today are based on articles 24 and 38 of the treaty on european union .
the new leaders withdrew into themselves , proving intransigent and so depriving themselves of the support of a large part of the population that did not accept the authoritarian procedures of the alliance .
now , when they are on the threshold of accession , it can not be too strongly emphasised that the overall goals and ambitions of a social europe will remain and can not be lowered .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 am .
in 1999 , around 190 000 tonnes were brought in .
the next item is the report by carl schlyter , on behalf of the committee on the environment , public health and food safety , on the proposal for a decision of the european parliament and of the council amending council directive 76/769/eec as regards restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations ( dichloromethane ) - c6-0068/2008 - .

women in prison , too , must be provided with appropriate health and hygiene facilities , different to those of the men .
finally , last but not least , cyprus . let me begin by saying that we much appreciate , and in a sense were reassured by - i say this to mr bertens - the fact that president clerides had the wisdom to avoid creating tension on the island by reconsidering the decision to deploy defensive missiles .
the european union will continue to support ukraine in these important efforts .
despite international protests , including from this chamber , the turkish government continues not merely to refuse to recognise but also to systematically violate the basic rights of the kurdish people .

i hope that india can sign this convention and that it will endeavour to solve these problems as soon as possible .
we are all agreed that public procurement is a major economic factor in the eu , accounting for 14-16 % of gross national income .
so , we are still waiting for the relevant documents to be tabled .
the agency is supported by the european parliament and the commission .
the speaker who said that the japanese , for their own internal reasons , are now very concerned about deregulation to modernize the economy was absolutely right .
on their national day , they are holding a massive day of protest , in which they are paralysing the fishing fleet in order to call for the adoption of measures needed to safeguard the present and the future of a sector that is vital not only for portugal but also for the various eu member states .
this will clearly happen , as long as those countries want it to happen .
- after the vote :
based on the above considerations , we are voting against this report .
naturally we attracted a great deal of attention in the media when we received president putin as a guest .
having accepted these advantages , it should have reciprocated by meeting requirements defined and ratified by the world trade organisation .
but even though , with a patchwork of policies based on national interests , the european aerospace industry has undoubtedly had a very different starting position to that of the united states , for example , a great number of encouraging developments have taken place on a european scale , especially over the past year .
it is true that in this respect , nobody is safe , neither israel nor , unfortunately , perhaps in the short-term , palestine .
mr president , commissioner , it is often said that history repeats itself and , with regard to south africa , this seems to be happening .
there are some encouraging signs that this may happen .
the process has been referred to the united nations again and will be debated again in the security council .
that was one of our guiding principles : not for the pleasure of rule-making , but because breaking common rules in a community based on the rule of law endangers the single currency .
for this reason it is absolutely essential that we test chemicals for their effects on the endocrine system .
second , we have to make the european investment fund industry more globally competitive .
this problem particularly affects the slovak republic .
the health and well-being of freight transport drivers as well as the safety of other road users depend on clear rules concerning issues such as working time , driving hours and periods of rest , as well as on effective inspections and penalties for non-compliance .
we therefore believe that helping african agriculture means supporting the socially responsible development of an agricultural model based on its own specific needs and on the food sovereignty and security of each country .
after the end of the war , the sri lankan president , mahinda rajapaksa , promised to investigate all suspected violations of military law and international humanitarian law during the military conflict .
mr president , as has already been said , uyghurs are not a minority but a people with an ancient silk road culture who gradually succumbed to chinese rule , which was initially very relaxed .
the commission and the council adopted most of what parliament requested at first reading .
alongside this , there are the statistics , country by country , of the infringement proceedings brought .

i understand that economic growth is projected to be 2.3 % in the european union and 2.1 % in the euro area in 2006 , up from 1.6 % and 1.3 % respectively in 2005 .
i therefore truly believe that , today , we are very far from a response that matches what is being implemented , for example , by the obama administration in the united states .
i will touch on that shortly .
i am opposed to the amendment which aims to increase the maximum boiling point for a volatile organic compound from 250°c to 280°c . since this has practically no environmental benefits , and since it is even doubtful whether it complies with the eco-labelling rules , this amendment may have highly negative repercussions for paint-manufacturing smes .
there are some who think that just because targets are set in this house in europe , they will be achieved .
gathering all these too tightly would only lead to an internal competitive battle . in the final analysis , this would be at the expense of the protection of human rights .
to resolve this , the 1993 constitution gave the president considerable powers and left the duma with the power to block all decisions and all reforms .
then , and only then , might you consider if human rights are affected .
needless to say , packaging plays an essential role , namely to protect the product , but a double layer of plastic for a small loaf of bread is surely somewhat excessive .
it will promote the exchange of good practice and establish appropriate contacts with management and labour .
that deserves our full attention , given the hour .
we have undertaken to achieve two things : to associate the candidate countries - although even the meaning of the word 'associate ' has not been defined , but it will probably not include voting rights ; we do not yet know .
i therefore welcome a code of behaviour for the banking and finance sector .
in my opinion a realistic budget is a budget that is in keeping with the objectives set for the common agricultural policy .

for the eu arrest warrant , and the proposed eu evidence warrant , to work successfully , there must be a level playing-field in respect of rights of suspects across the union .
your legal service is entirely right .
first , a european roma strategy should be created as soon as possible and should primarily focus on improving the living conditions of the roma in europe , creating jobs for the almost 90 % of roma who are jobless , combating anti-gypsyism , supporting the education of roma , bringing health into roma houses and promoting roma political inclusion .
now to the issue of staffing and personnel expenditure , which was just raised by mrs buitenweg and mr escobar .
the debate is closed .
taking forward policies on immigration , asylum and the integration of immigrants in our society are other key elements .
many differences can be explained by the tensions between existing common interests and values and global economic competition between the eu and the usa . this became particularly clear in the gatt negotiations and will certainly also come to light again when the new round is opened .
we , however , can not look upon not-for-profit organisations as the main source of terrorist funding , as do some of the rapporteurs in this house .
i do not believe that the european union 's political coordination in the un is as bad as mr laschet suggests in his excellent report .

the current proposal aims to achieve a high level of environmental protection while at the same time contributing to proper functioning of the internal market for batteries .
pakistan 's experience of democracy in the past 60 years has been troubled .
new work patterns were introduced abruptly , and the group became over-centralised .
torture is reported to remain widespread .
at that igc we gained the support of 12 , 13 or 14 member states in quite a number of areas .
to get back to my specific points : the european investment bank ( eib ) is an important instrument in three areas .
my group is also calling for an implant passport to be introduced , which would give information both about the characteristics of the implant and about the necessary post-operative care and would identify the surgeon .
in the past in this house , we have deeply regretted the failure to meet these commitments , which has clearly hindered the action of the international authorities in kosovo . there are now new elements involved and some of these commitments are now being met .
in recent weeks , our discussions have centred around dangerous substances and the conditions under which they can , or must , be removed from the market .
i should like to avoid being drawn into domestic affairs .
unfortunately , i am afraid that most of the candidates will have to make the sacrifice once again .
i want to appeal to all the groups in this house to put an end to this ideological dispute , which is detrimental to the matter in hand .
unfortunately , while the idea of convening the council was not a bad idea , it suffered most in the execution .
in writing . - ( fr ) this report on the cap and global food security provided us with a fantastic opportunity to reflect on how we can ensure that european agriculture plays a full part in achieving the planet 's food balance .
it is too depressing for words .
we vote in favour of this report , because we think its content is good .
the netherlands has already noted that the appeal at the court of justice can then be withdrawn , and i believe that the european parliament could follow suit .
the first was achieved by the vote , which threw berisha out .
mr president , the saga of the leghold trap is a sad and sorry one .
there is no doubt that the aims of the directive , namely to reduce and prevent nitrate pollution , were correct .
however , i question whether a simple reduction in the customs tariff will have the desired effect .
mr president , as members know , it is customary in our speeches to congratulate the rapporteur .
nevertheless , i would like to highlight three aspects which seem to me very important .
it will also facilitate recognition of court rulings .
today the single currency is a reality for 329 million of our fellow european citizens .
i believe that we can not paralyse debates , but that we should go ahead .
secondly , i should like to mention the organisations which are being set up and developed by the social partners .
crime in our cities is a real problem , as it is based on organised crime , which threatens cross-border social order .
( fr ) madam president , ladies and gentlemen , in many respects , it is essential that we vote in favour , tomorrow , of amending the european refugee fund , and it is on this subject that i will focus my speech , at the same time as congratulating mr coelho and mr tavares on their deliberations and their work .
kazakhstan will indeed hold the chairmanship of the osce in 2010 .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i must admit to the commissioner that i found his speech extraordinarily disappointing .
europe can not be built upon mathematical equations , but on political trust .
the mission conferred in the treaty of amsterdam , to oppose all forms of discrimination , is still , for women at least , just a vague hope .
we feel that reference to these tests is unnecessary and can be omitted , given that our aim is to harmonize the provisions governing comparative advertising .
this resolution obscures the fundamental issue , the ‘cause of causes’ , that is to say the role of the united states and of israel , which is in military occupation of palestinian , syrian and even lebanese territory , in aggravating the situation in the middle east .
that is why i believe that we were right to take action quickly , to recognise the urgency of the situation and make funds available .
then , in the matters of external relations and administration , things get pretty complicated .
what we can do , however , is to reduce the probability of risk by taking careful action .
i understand - unless the commission can contradict me this evening - that the commission may have to apply for an extension of the deadline .
we must find a way to talk and maintain these channels .
the european union finances development assistance from our taxes , and we know very little about its effectiveness .
there is no doubt that this debate is taking place , among other reasons , because of the commission’s communication on the textile industry in the context of an enlarged europe , for which i want to thank the commission .
member of the commission . - ( cs ) mr chairman , ladies and gentlemen , first of all i would like to thank mrs lynne for her detailed and topical report .
it is , of course , obvious that neither the commission nor this house would ever allow themselves to interfere in the judges ' work .
consequently , with enlargement , the centre of gravity of cohesion policy is going to shift eastwards .
this will have an impact on the competitiveness of companies of all sizes in this sector and accordingly on a great many jobs .
mr president-in-office of the council , i welcomed your comments on relations with ukraine .
mr president , high representative , commissioner , i have two questions for you , mr solana .
we also ought to recognise this significant initiative within this framework at community level .
we can not rely on a single country or a small number of countries for our energy supply , but need diversity of suppliers too , and the principle of solidarity among all member states of the eu applies here – we can not leave anyone in the lurch .
the wool sector provides the potential to generate good employment in rural areas , provided we have proper structures in place .
a set of minimum requirements must be drawn up and incorporated into a legislative act which should be part of a comprehensive strategy addressing all forms of gender-based violence .
human rights do not exist in isolation , neither should they be considered in abstract .
consumers will thus be informed of the actual price ( price of ticket plus the various charges and taxes ) . '
it brings us more democracy , strengthens the european parliament , and involves the national parliaments in the lawmaking process .
you will be well aware of what significance submarines had for the previous commission and what the consequences were .
climate change is contributing to the increase in natural disasters , but many cases are still unforeseeable or are caused by criminal acts .
i therefore support this decision , which allows the mobilisation of eur 2 405 671 under the general eu budget for 2010 in order to provide financial assistance in response to the portuguese request .
the socialist group wants to see a review of social security but as mr willockx 's report points out , we want to do it on the basis of ensuring that we keep a social safety net .
we also underlined the importance of providing information and genuine consultation with workers concerning the safety case and safety assessments , not only of sites dealing with spent fuel and radioactive waste , but also as regards how these should be transported , and the need for a rigorous and effective inspection regime with sanctions that are effective , dissuasive and proportionate .
therefore , pursuant to rule 123 of the rules of procedure , it will be forwarded to its addressees and published , together with the names of its signatories , in the texts adopted for this part-session .
will the proclaimed new strategy suffer a similar fate to its predecessor ?
at the same time , however , we must be much more forceful with regard to the external challenges : security and defence , but also trade , technological and industrial standards , and environmental standards .
the very intensive growth of air transport which we have witnessed requires absolute compliance with procedures and maintenance of strict technical discipline .
i point out the fact that only 6 % of the production costs of new cars are personnel costs .
the possibility of utilising and exhausting stocks was a very important issue , as has been remarked upon in this report .
in the interests of production planning for the next few years , it is important that the decision-making on the extension of quotas be completed as quickly as possible .
hydrogen has different properties to conventional fuels such as petrol and diesel , so the proposal makes a priority of determining the necessary safety requirements .
the remainder of the amendment remains unchanged .
the union was born with mistakes , but at least it exists .
yesterday we debated the difficult economic situation faced by certain countries in the euro area , especially the critical situation faced by greece .
a range of measures are needed to make this possible and this is what we have been calling for .
within the framework of its legislative proposal , the commission will therefore include a biofuel sustainability scheme designed to ensure that the biofuel sector plays its part in tackling this issue .
in general , the rapporteur has made the directive stronger and more concrete , more ambitious and effective .
( fr ) mr president , at a time when we are only just beginning to digest the effects of the financial crisis , it is certainly not forbidden to consider fundamental issues such as innovative tax mechanisms and to propose new avenues such as eurobonds .
it would not shock me at all if this practice were to be recognised and authorised .
i would like to congratulate the dutch presidency on the exhaustive hague programme in relation to the area of freedom , but i would like to add a brief comment .
the arab countries gave the proposal a positive reception .
it would have been ideal to hear the opinion of all member states .
the european union , through the european instrument for democracy and human rights , supports the activities of civil society organisations in this very specific area .
this view has been expressed in the commission communication on the introduction of third generation mobile communications in the european union that was adopted on 20 march 2001 .
prevention must be combined with penalties .
they have found two cracks here . one crack is the 2006 directive , which has already been mentioned ; the other crack is the regulation on cooperation between the member states .
it was achieved with the support of the president , the industry commissioner , the research commissioner , the budget commissioner and many others .
that is in no way intended to imply that some countries have no right to express an opinion .
i also recall that my group , the confederal group of the european united left/nordic green left , voted against this in committee .
the problem is that i am receiving a bribe - in kind , money or services - and that is not changed by declaring it .
i find this regrettable .
studies show that reducing greenhouse gas emissions by as much as is needed to pre-empt the worst scenarios will slow down worldwide economic growth by around 1 % .
it is the same date in both cases .
europe can only be built by means of effective action and decisions that will be forever writ large in the history of our continent .
the citizens ' initiative was a powerful and convincing argument against the 'no ' side in the treaty of lisbon referendum in ireland , especially when they argued that it was a grab for power by the european union rather than a truly democratic attempt to involve the citizens .
we must also interlink them .
i would conclude by stressing that the present situation was caused largely by the european union 's current shortcomings in tackling common foreign and security policy problems .
so please , keep things in perspective .
i think that this structural discussion should really be held next year , and i hope that this commissioner can give the initial impetus for this .
whatever we are able to do to boost development of the private sector , to improve the conditions under which small and medium-sized enterprises operate , to modernise infrastructures and encourage the promotion of investments , industrial cooperation and trade , will be gratefully received , for hitherto there has been no support for the economic and production networks of the partner countries and industrial cooperation has played an extremely minor role due to the lack of direct support programmes and joint initiatives between european companies and partner countries .
they mean economic productivity at the same time .
finally , as regards the rome i regulation , the preamble to the proposal makes it clear that the proposal is without prejudice to the regulation .
it should be emphasized that this recommendation does not stem from a rejection of the principles of the government procurement agreement concluded in connection with the uruguay round .
but bombs do not concern those who do not travel either by rer or by metro .
if , on the other hand , you want to do battle on serious issues , you know that , even where there are justified differences , the socialist group is ready to discuss those issues seriously .
this applies both to the idea of extending qualified majority voting , impossible without revising the weightings to take account of the demographic and economic importance of the member states , and as regards reforming the structure of the commission to enable it to play the full part assigned to it by the treaties while at the same time safeguarding the legitimate rights of smaller states , which are full members of the union .
in the resolution , the european parliament chooses , in spite of this , to anticipate the study and to ask the convention to look into the possibilities of finding a legal basis for a european corps of border guards , and the council to set up such a force .
during this dialogue , the eu has regularly brought to the attention of the chinese authorities , at every session , and most recently in beijing on 24 september 2004 , the situation of individuals who have been sentenced for having expressed their opinion or their beliefs .
as a result it has faced enormous internal pressure and threatened instability .
if adequate countermeasures are not taken , there is a genuine risk of very real technological repercussions over the next few years for the army of a country that is antidemocratic , illiberal and a dictatorship and that knows how to turn secret services and specifically civil espionage to military use , something that our own intelligence organisations are , in any case , also doing .
they lost , however .
the first is a proposal to extend the scope to include intermodal transport .
to do this , i believe it is very important not to forget the aspect of communication in these decisions , because these decisions have to be understood and accepted by the citizen .
against this backdrop , it is extremely odd that the discussion should not revolve around an effective approach to tax fraud but around the question of what legal basis this directive should have .
we need a comprehensive discussion of all the issues , from allowing exiles to return through to the wall .
schools can not , of course , be encyclopaedias , nor should they conform to stereotypical international standards , or merely churn out hackneyed clichés .
mutual trade amounts to approximately eur 1 billion per day .
let us first put it to the vote leaving out the word 'bannissement ' and the names .
these reports have been compiled for years , but the council has not even once yet included these reports on its agenda .
it wants codecision as regards debates about content and form , and it wants codecision as regards financial resources .
this is why the commission has advocated in the past , in its white paper on freeing european airspace , that european airspace should be managed centrally by a strong international organisation for all aspects of its use .
( applause )
this is the right word to describe them and all concomitant conclusions should be drawn from that .
this assessment should cover both the directive’s impact on hauliers and on the road haulage market , and its impact in terms of furthering our goal of increasing the market share of railways .
let us acknowledge once and for all that europe is secular and contains many different religions .
i therefore call on the commission to support this amendment , and at the same time i demand that the commission conduct a risk analysis into all antibiotic growth promotors .
article 280 of the ec treaty clearly states that , `` the community and the member states shall counter fraud and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the community through measures to be taken in accordance with this article , which shall act as a deterrent and be such as to afford effective protection ... '' .
i am sure the president-in-office is correct in saying that a single currency requires the deepening of our economic cooperation .
the reason i say that is because there are greater protections available to individuals to challenge national authorities when they misuse , abuse or lose their data than would be available in this framework decision , and in many ways , if we force this framework decision on protection of data to apply to national data as well , we will undermine the rights that already exist .
the forthcoming conference can be assured that parliament takes this issue very seriously .
we are not talking about something insignificant , but about one of the fundamental principles of the eu ; freedom of movement .
it will ensure that the conditions for accession are met .
i am concerned , as are the other speakers , at the plight of the people in iraq .
i welcome the statement today by the eu envoy in israel , ramiro cibrian-uzal , who said that the eu and israel have put negotiations on the upgrading of relations 'on hold ' at this time for these reasons .
i think they have all been alert and that that all possible precautionary measures were taken .
we must put a stop to the practice whereby each of the most important eu institutions acts in this area in some sense , if i may use the phrase , on its own initiative .
counter-terrorism demands , thirdly , that we set up joint investigatory teams within the framework of collaboration between europol analysts and representatives of the member states .
now it is time to look at the agency carefully .
however , as we have seen , everything will depend on exogenous factors which could turn this agreement into nothing but a piece of paper with no real significance .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the political ultimatum of the ukrainian government - and this is what it seems to be about - not to shut down chernobyl if international funding for r4 and k2 is not forthcoming , must not be allowed to succeed .
.
the current enlargement concept will inevitably bring about new divisive borders in europe , for example between poland and ukraine .
we must guarantee that its massive oil wealth be used to build prosperity for its peoples , not for arms purchases .
we can also concur with mr schnellhardt’s criticism of the procedure , a criticism that can also apply where this point is concerned .
i have just re-read the report and must come to the conclusion that a large number of subjects dealt with at the time are regrettably still highly topical , such as the position of women .
i would like to stress that it is impossible to curb rising poverty in a year .
i am very glad that representatives of the council are here .
this means that , whilst working to safeguard our interests , we should also consider others , whether that means individuals , peoples , minorities or countries .
i believe that it is necessary to re-establish legal conditions in the labour market as a matter of principle , whether in relation to european citizens or citizens from third countries who sometimes work without any minimum safety conditions at their workplace .
how can this house ask me whether or not i am aware of problems of civil liberties ?
we have therefore tried to be flexible .
we are dealing with a totally unjustified conflict .
human rights , which include women 's rights , are and need to be universal and defended in any context .
those who believe , and are always making their views known , that basically we could do without it , since the first rank of candidates for accession to the community are already so far developed that they no longer need it , are deceiving themselves , for they are the very ones who have a long way to go to catch up , as an extremely poor region has bordered on a relatively rich one for a very long time .
as such , we in this group also support strongly the call for a europe-wide study to be undertaken , clearly in cooperation with the who , because we want to spread the knowledge and gather the knowledge as widely as possible .
other speakers mentioned a promise by president barroso to adopt a horizontal directive – that was the term used – on the strengthening of and respect for rights in the area of non-discrimination .
resolution on political developments in russia
i would like to know how the commission intends to act in situations that have unfortunately reoccurred , given that in the future the regis initiative will cease to exist , particularly since while the commission increased its technical justifications , the united states army , for instance , offered cooperation in carrying out the technical restoration of the ribeiro quente area .
on behalf of the verts/ale group . - ( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the verts/ale group supports this proposal and it supports it on two counts , because we feel that it is important to discuss what is happening to the roma in the european union as such - being only too well aware of recent events in italy - and also because we all know that the european union has the means to intervene , but those means are not well known and tend not to come up for discussion .
in paragraph 3 , therefore , rather than ‘the main objective of the changes made by the council in january 2005’ , it should say ‘the changes to the supplementary measures accompanying the council 's common position’ .
it is therefore absolutely essential that vice-president de palacio take decisive action , as she has done so far , in order to establish a real single european sky .
chechnya
it is symptomatic of a wrong choice of course in european industrial policy .
we will be fooling the candidate countries if we lead them to believe that we are doing them a favour by allowing them to join a union that is not in full working order .
this year’s report also sets out , for the first time , to provide readers with practical examples of the eu in action .
to turn in upon ourselves and return to outmoded concepts of sovereignty are inadequate responses in a globalised world .
there is just a note of caution i wish to give my colleagues in parliament .
patients , doctors and companies alike must therefore have access to any information not covered by business secrecy protection .
so why is such analysis absent from the annual report ?
mr president , commissioner , i would like to begin by saying that my feelings about this debate are bittersweet .
the package adopted by the european commission last week is the result of an expert approach .
as a member responsible for public health , i can not emphasise strongly enough how closely our demographic problems are linked to public health problems .
it is a risk we are not prepared to take because the conservative forces dominate the whole eu system .
unheard of in a democracy !
this is also absurd , mr president , or is it the case that in the member states a councillor of a small town is paid the same as a councillor of the large city , or a councillor the same as a senator ?
having paid a very large amount of money as bail , he was released and for twelve years he heard nothing more about this case .
quite simply , we will remain vigilant because much will now depend on the commission , and we hope that when it takes measures to support the findings of scientific experts , it will prove to be very ambitious in classifying future priority substances and priority hazardous substances , the famous 13 substances that are to be classified in the very near future .
i also voted for amendment 6 by mr struan stevenson in relation to doing away with the scandalous business of the discarding of haddock .
we need , on the contrary , to make these issues the subject of a genuine choice reflecting the view of society as a whole and , therefore , to give some thought to an alternative transport policy in europe , edging out road transport , which produces a lot of greenhouse gases .
now let us just consider this charter of fundamental rights .
however , i believe that , although the 2011 budget is not bad , it could have been better .
i do not want now to go into the type of standards , which in some cases i regard as fairly low .
it is not too late for us to do something about it .
safety must be the main concern .
( ro ) three years after their accession to the european union , romanians and bulgarians do not enjoy full rights as european citizens .
in some member states over-regulation has led to draconian competition where no operator generates any revenues .
but it is important that we should make this point here : no terrorist and no terrorist organization can derive any political legitimacy from a law ...
i look forward to receiving the report the commissioner talked about on the development of our forestries .
independent workers are not another race .
other suggestions in the report , such as specific aid to improve the bee population through rearing apiaries , can already be implemented under the current regulation , without the need for any new legal provisions .
we see it as an indisputable truth – and as one that we must join together in communicating throughout europe – that the production of biofuels and bio-propellants of every kind , ranging across the whole spectrum from biodiesel to ethanol , can not work if it is detrimental to the environment .
neither can we see why the european board of a multinational company should justify its relocation to one of its branch establishments , where production costs will be cheaper , solely on the grounds that labour costs have forced such a move .
it is also common sense that , if we advocate community agricultural and fisheries policies , financial decisions should comply with the true meaning of those words and that the institutions should honour their commitments .
we are talking here about 1 521 directives or texts that enable the internal market to function , and that is a lot .
i believe that modulation should also take into account new production techniques , but not to the detriment of the important obligation of keeping people employed , given that if the european union spends so much on tobacco , it does so especially because it has a major obligation to maintain jobs in the many regions that have very serious problems of employment .
the gradual harmonisation of transport infrastructure charges is the most important step towards that .
the problem of employment and the dignity of working conditions and of standards of living is still unresolved ; as for enlargement , our capacities to tackle this adequately with regard to our own peoples and the peoples of the candidate countries , the necessary structures , the economic adjustments and the political and social relationships require further development and greater consistency .
in writing . - ( pt ) the aim of this proposal for a directive is to introduce better toy safety requirements , mainly in connection with the use of chemical substances and electrical properties .
fighting terrorism also means defending human rights and democracy .
china and india train highly educated people for the job market far more than is the case in the eu .
finally , i would like to note that at the moment it faces its first challenge of visibility , of history , with the proposal for a mediterranean union made by mr sarkozy .
mr president , i can sum up this debate fairly briefly and , i hope , at a reasonable pace .
now , i would just like to ask you further whether you can give me answers on two specific points .
neither should the constant threat under which israeli children live be allowed .
i will not continue mr president , because this is a public debate and i prefer to stop here .
in the second part of your answer , you mentioned an absolutely key issue , namely that there is not only a race to carry out wage dumping , but also a subsidies race .
i also support mr seppänen’s request that the participants at madrid should be consulted .
we are well aware that support from public funds is no substitute for the efforts of private investors .
within the leading group , there are also conflicting economic interests in the extraction of minerals , in the felling of tropical rain forest and in the production of opium .
the european negotiators have succeeded in cutting mixed aid in the form of loans down to 20 % . but the united states remain determined to use this type of aid , which permanently saddles the most needy countries with a debt burden , even if this is at a reduced interest rate and if it does not have to be paid off for another 30 years .
it is not always evident how best to integrate health requirements in community policies or to evaluate the health impact of a particular policy or action of the member states on community citizens .
there should be encouragement of initiatives to create a greater number of and better-suited childcare services ; provision for special leave flexibility for parents ; and the establishment of working environments adapted to the needs of parents .
what is more , i would like to know from the commission – and i hope its members are listening to me – whether or not its intentions to improve the decision-making system relating to external programmes are genuine , because there are conflicting opinions on this that i would like it to clarify for me .
the incredible thing is that the regime is actually in earnest , given that sentences as long as 26 years have already been inflicted .
in a few days , the wto will rule on the import regime for bananas and therefore on the possible sanctions that might be taken by countries which consider themselves to be prejudiced by this regime .
during this extension phase , farc launched a campaign of kidnappings and murders , which culminated in the murder of senator daniels and the kidnapping of a presidential candidate , mrs ingrid betancourt .
i wholeheartedly support this resolution , which strongly condemns the growing number of attacks against christian communities .
if the council had wanted to play a role , it should have adopted an interinstitutional agreement which would have put an end to the unacceptable situation that the european parliament is not , formally speaking , sufficiently involved in the results of social dialogue .
the doubly black market in synthetic drugs - which are extremely varied and unidentifiable - is one of the greatest threats to our young people .
i was immediately struck by something on page 5 , where as regards the form of future european legislation with a view to the planned harmonisation , three proposals have been made .
thank you very much for your answer .
to that end , it demands that member states and the european institutions establish concrete measures to promote reintegration into the labour market worthy of those people who are living in poverty .
i can tell you that , after verification , there has been no abuse of voting rights .
the greeks have produced a fantastic achievement .
this means that the european union must be prepared to assume its role there in 2007 .
however loud you attack socialist cuba , my dear fellow members , you can not deny the fact that cuba is the only free country on the american continent , the only country where the people take authority into their own hands .
but this has nothing to do with employment contracts in the commission .
in fact , the commission will be able to submit proposals on how to make better use of existing capacities and identify solutions in energy crisis situations .
carrier preselection is an excellent way for the consumer to benefit in the short term from the european liberalization policy .
many people have asked : why do we need galileo when we already have gps ?
i want to ask two questions : first , what level of complementarity are you looking at when the commission is trying to set an arrangement in place to work with the united nations , or are we merely going to give the united nations the money they require and they will do the delivery on the floor ?
in no circumstances should these provisions impact negatively on passengers .
we have no mechanisms for that .
( b5-0163/2002 ) by mrs carrilho , mr evans , mrs erika mann , mr fruteau and mr van den berg , on behalf of the pse group , on the political situation in sri lanka ;
there is also a need to harmonize the various agreements that exist at present .
so long live globalisation , but long live globalisation in both directions !
european citizens , as we all know , are calling for the competences of the european parliament to be strengthened , not weakened .
but he must understand the feelings of this house .
the commission therefore believes its existing legislation provides the necessary mechanisms for effective management of food crises and effective consumer protection .
so this must include everything from security in the social context of solidarity to nuclear safety in the context of dangerous power stations .
strategies and actions plans for roma integration have been and are available at every level , but it is their proper implementation that is lacking .
why not say so then ?
i hope the russian people are able to chart a safe course in this direction .
i think the eu should continue its open door policy in respect of ukraine .
'calls on the member states , the commission and the council ... to assist in ascertaining the truth by opening inquiries or collaborating with the competent bodies , ... and by ensuring effective parliamentary scrutiny of the action of secret services ' ;
i will be putting that to my own group leader , and i hope others will do the same , but i would also ask you to bring it up with the bureau .
we are aware that we have to take action because this is a vital issue , but that we have to do it in such a way that each directive is socially , financially and economically acceptable to the union as a whole and to each member state individually .
i would appeal to you to make an effort to ensure that , in particular , the responsible ministers in the governments – that is to say , most notably the finance ministers and , of course , the prime ministers – understand that social security and economic growth are not incompatible but are prerequisites of each other .
i congratulate you on being able to express yourself in less than the time allotted to you .
the affirmation in paragraph 35 that rural development measures should be aimed directly at farmers strengthens junilistan 's impression that the old , overburdened 'common agricultural policy ' has now merely changed its name to 'rural development ' in the eu budget .
the european court of human rights considered that moscow has given sufficient guarantees to allow persons of chechen origin who appear to be terrorists to be extradited to russia .
we have to prepare the arguments against those who claim that this would push sudan closer towards chinese business interests .
this is a country that over the last 12 to 18 months has engaged in massive and irreversible steps on the road to economic reform , in particular in industry and agriculture .
a great deal is at stake .
almost 10 % of europe 's children suffer from 'dys ' problems : children who are usually invisible to our education systems , which all too frequently blame their academic failure on unrelated causes .
however , if you could take account on your list when calculating the proportionality of the supplementary questions ( and i get more than my fair share ) , of the length of time members are in the house - rather than some members being able to come in and get a supplementary immediately , just because you are balancing the political groups , or whatever - i think we would all be quite happy to comply with your rule of thumb .
if necessary , the commission would not hesitate to recommend the use of the safeguard clauses of postponement provided for in the accession treaty of bulgaria and romania .
they do not have a second state to resort to and , for that reason , they have been ghettoised .
this fact should not be overshadowed by the single irish 'no ' .
it is well known that portugal was not a founder member state of the european communities .
our rapporteur is concerned about 'the low budget allocated to save ii ' and says that , as a result , 'the programme 's potential is being overestimated . '
my third point concerns the european area .
likewise , i am not in favour of , and i quote : ‘ensuring a readjustment in favour of the second pillar’ .
today , more than ever , parliament appeals to all member states to be determined in their support for the spanish authorities in their fight against terrorism .
we still have hopes that we will be able to return to this issue .
we have no other instrument .
a concern for sustainability is something else we can expect from women and women’s networks .
the advertising revenue from which television channels benefit should not suffer thereby as , in our world of globalisation and of the proliferation of transnational enterprises , the demand for advertising is expanding and will continue to do so .
the debate is closed .
nonetheless , generally when we talk of democracy and peaceful coexistence in an area in which violence is a daily reality , we need to take account of two serious factors .
the fact is that after more than ten years and 17 un resolutions , the iraqi regime is still delaying destroying its illegal weapons .
that also means , then - and this is the common position we adopted in elsinore - that we must listen to the security council and be willing to accommodate its requirements of us .
we do not owe them solidarity .
this report requires the certification of machinery and lifts to be based on criteria that will provide greater security for users .
we must support the commissioner in his determined attempts to protest and , if necessary , retaliate - but carefully .
madam president , i am going to limit myself to contributing some additional information to this debate .
that is why an effort to devise a suitable compromise in this regard is needed .
i have to refer the matter to my colleague , commissioner de palacio , who will have all the details and can give you more information , but i assure you this has definitely been on our agenda and we are interested in finding a solution .
ideally , the committee on budgets should have been consulted again at a later stage and i am sorry this did not take place .
one of the most contentious topics was , and still remains , the one referred to as 'geographical balance ' .
it will not hesitate to take firm action against member states if directives are not properly implemented .
we had great problems , in the last legislature in 1999 , with negotiating a financial perspective which then tied not only the current parliament and commission , but also subsequent ones , to a situation where they could not revise it .
the same does not apply , however , to olive oil and to cotton , where the aim is not to restructure nor to convert or guide production or producers to other products .
this means we are covering a very broad spectrum in anti-discrimination measures .
( ro ) i wish to thank almost 500 of our fellow members who voted overwhelmingly yesterday against the use of cyanide technologies in mining .
i agree it was stupid to set the same margin for manoeuvre - 3 % - for all countries , as some are already in a great deal of debt , while others are not . some only contribute marginally to european aggregate data , while others are the driving force of the common market .
this was a complex and very emotional topic that many people in europe feel very strongly about , and it involved using a new procedure , the codecision procedure , so thank you .
through this idea of increasing transparency , which we support , we also wish to draw attention to the fact that member states share the management of 80 % of the funds , and so we again call for member states to submit national declarations of assurance .
consequently , the european union aims to encourage a process of transition to pluralist democracy , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , and sustainable recovery and improvement in the living standards of the cuban people .
it is something that the parliament 's intergroup for animal welfare , which i have the honour to chair at the moment , has demanded for a very long time .
there are many examples here and health is one of them .
the main african , caribbean and pacific ( acp ) banana-supplying countries may face difficulties following the liberalisation of customs duties implemented under the most favoured nation tariff within the framework of the world trade organisation and the bilateral and regional agreements concluded , or which are in the process of being concluded , between the eu and certain latin american countries .
our aim is to take a decision on this improved recovery plan together with the fisheries reform in december .
belief is an integral part of the human condition .
roman law at the time of justinian stated that it was better for a guilty person to go unpunished than for an innocent person to be deprived of their life .
this is a good compromise , which will take europe forward in line with the interests of its population .
in view of the continuation of all the community acquis on the single market and of the treaty of maastricht , they will not be satisfied with a subparagraph 2 of article 3 which promises paradise on earth .
some of what is contained in the stockholm programme is not liberal , and neither is it humane or far-sighted .
details concerning the link between a piece of meat and the individual animal are set out clearly in article 3 ( 2 ) of the draft regulation .
on behalf of the alde group . - mr president , congratulations to mr vakalis for his excellent work .
as you know , the housing issue is among those few issues which are still outstanding in the negotiations in the council , in addition to some other very difficult issues on which parliament has also voted , including cofinancing rates and eligibility of vat .
in this respect , the commission has already included a reference to the principles of the code in several international agreements with third countries and aims at including this reference in future agreements .
they will react against the already perceptible dangers of dislocation , isolation and depression of remote and structurally weak areas , and will not allow the ambitions of capital to entrap and bleed dry the 'grey matter ' of europe and bring about the suppression of citizens ' rights , acquisitions and liberties .
what i wonder is : who thinks up such proposals ?
in the run-up to this reunification , sweden’s social democrats had painted horrific pictures of how our country would be invaded by foreign workers who would dump our wages and exploit our social benefits .
the new proposal for a directive is throwing the existing regulation into utter confusion and threatens drastically to restrict the member states ' policy room to determine conditions on the basis of general interest , monitoring the quality of society and the environment and guaranteeing fundamental rights .
i would really like to thank parliament , in particular , the two rapporteurs , ms bauer and ms hedh , the shadow rapporteurs and all the others who made it possible to reach an agreement .
in the revision of the treaties there will have to be a thorough appreciation of the citizens ' views .
it wants the european institutions to be the ones to decide how , when and why to use this tool , freely and without the need to coordinate with the authorities of the country to be stabilised ; this makes it a de facto mechanism designed for the covert defence of european interests .
i am sure we will be doing that in the next few months although it is important for us to concentrate on the real priorities for the igc before nice .
we must therefore also give consideration to mediterranean europe , along with europe 's involvement in the maghreb and the mashreq , the middle east and even those countries in southern africa awaiting our cooperation , the acp countries and the countries of latin america .
once it has been adopted , the commission will work with parliament and the member states to ensure that it achieves its goal .
however , special attention should be given to a number of factors relating to its construction .
i would like to congratulate mrs. gurmai for her report and i am convinced that , due to her as well , the roadmap to be drafted by the commission in the autumn of 2008 , for speeding up the introduction of incentives for intelligent cars , will be more ambitious .
however , i would also like to stress the social aspect of this legislation as regards the rights of disabled people , especially blind or partially sighted people , and their right to avail of free postal services .
it is also about obtaining safe storage of this dangerous substance , something that i think is very positive .
however , as the european union has already stated , it would obviously prefer a palestinian state to emerge from a completed process of negotiation .
the checks are pointless in any case , as we are told that the margin of error is 1 % , whereas scientists tell us that it is in fact 40 % .
there are , unfortunately , numerous reports of torture .
moving on to employment , the second point of the triangle , we must live up to the expectations of our fellow citizens , for whom jobs remain the paramount concern .
president-in-office . - ( sl ) i am happy to be here with you today and to take part in such an important debate .
the liberal party has always pushed for everyone , regardless of sexual orientation or marital status , to be able to apply for adoption .
we fully agree with the commission proposal to maintain the use of one , two or three varieties .
nevertheless , the political analysis of the lisbon summit reveals that there were two proposals : one which was more social , more committed , which came from the french prime minister , mr jospin , and the other , resulting from a previous agreement between mr blair and mr aznar , deregulating the labour market and making it more flexible .
one of these , for example , would be to have a total budget allowance , similar to the system we set up for ireland and other regions , to cover phasing out and a transitional period , particularly for those regions which were closest to the average .
the creation of four special reserves , totalling ecu 1.6 billion in commitments and ecu 4 billion in payments , is unacceptable .
it is a great pity that we are moving away from the social policy aspects of these funds , which provided some relief for companies and , in particular , the workers of companies who were being restructured .
asia has been sick , but europe will start sniffling if we are not careful and europe has done relatively well with the euro .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
i would invite you to take a look at my website , where i have set up a lobby ticker that registers every lobbyist contact , irrespective of whether or not i am currently working on a legislative initiative .
such a situation was incongruous .
( nl ) europe is rightly staking a lot on maintaining and strengthening competitiveness and we know how to keep our market share in essential sectors but , as the commissioner has just said , we are only in the first wave of globalisation .
however , it is not so much about wording but about application and the way we can encourage the partners to come up with their own solutions , because , as we have always made clear , we do not want to impose everything on the others : we want to encourage their societies to build and to change .
i hope that , at least in the future , some sort of order can be re-established ; if this is not the case , then tell us clearly that parliament ' s work is in the hands of the presidency and not the rules of procedure .
written statements ( rule 142 )
when , in this very house , we debate problems that focus on the lack of harmonization , for example , in the sizing of processed peas , the capacity of moped engines or the speed of forestry tractors , we tend to overlook those citizens who , whether nationals or frontier residents in a member state , are unable to work in the adjoining member state without coming up against insurmountable administrative , social or tax problems .
i believe , in actual fact , that we have here a package that should not be broken up .
not surprisingly , this report contains a ringing endorsement of the draft european constitution , the effect of which would be , however , to remove the definition of fundamental human rights from the competence of each nation , and to shift it instead to european level , where no one is in control of anything any more .
they represent a fault line running across europe which may well give rise to further problems .
you have missed the point mr barroso .
constructive solutions need to be found for this age-old issue of tibet .
after all , aid is granted only when necessary and when justified by the circumstances .
as for your congratulations to the commission for the work done so far in the maritime sector , i shall pass these on to the staff of the directorate-general for energy and transport following the magnificent work they have carried out throughout this long year , in which they have undoubtedly made a very considerable effort to respond to our citizens ' growing demands .
generally high development costs and low profit expectations have meant those sectors did not initially appeal to foreign private companies .
not enough is known about these opportunities and , therefore , they are not utilised enough .
political and economic decision makers have a responsibility to take heed of people with disabilities .
alongside the issue of what , realistically , can be part of such a directive – it should cover a very large number of tools and concepts , as well as its being possible to monitor compliance – i believe quite simply that it is too early to decide whether such a framework directive is necessary .
my thanks to the presidency for its clarity in this regard .
i recognise that this report is extremely sensitive for fishermen who come from the mediterranean and those who fish in the atlantic .
firstly , the great differences in the level of economic development in different euro area countries was ignored .
we are here to defend our own , the citizens of our nations , this large majority - for now - of europeans who are in your eyes invisible , inaudible and contemptible .
as you will know , this is one of my pet subjects , and my team and i have been working especially hard to achieve progress .
it is the very argument to conclude an agreement with macedonia and not yet with albania that cause us so much concern , so much so that a passive stance from the union vis-à-vis albania is really not acceptable .
'yes ' to the creation of an intermediate category of support for the regions .
they have been temporarily suspended and are currently complying with these requirements and i hope that they will be quickly put in order .
if a solution is not possible , how will it react when the european union enlarges ?
we believe this is necessary because the transport manager should also have decent working conditions .
that there is particularly deep-seated frustration among rural communities is no secret .
this is a singular slap in the face for the european parliament and the european union .
and there is in france , from this point of view , much abuse where trade union freedom is concerned , since it is only possible for workers to stand for professional elections if they are members of unions which are duly approved and limited by law .
these same countries are very often those sought by asylum seekers .
as commissioner or the commission - you do not , of course , know what responsibility you will have in future - you should ensure that these countries do , in fact , improve so that the information is gathered and the supervision can be monitored .
as a member of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , i am also most grateful to mr schwaiger for taking the view that consumer protection , animal welfare and health are very important issues which we will deal with as priorities at a later date .
a total of 30 countries presently take part .
i do not believe there is any justification for setting a date for the introduction of this scheme until the impact of eid , particularly in relation to traceability and disease control , has been assessed .
we should like to agree with commissioner špidla on the need to move towards social dialogue .
the monitoring functions of the committee on petitions with respect to the work of the european commission are exceptionally important .
not even two months later , a similar number of christians were murdered in just two hours .
is it not the case that the partnership principle in lomé actually might lie at the heart of the problem ?
the commission will , therefore , be able to set the eu 's joint priorities regarding resettlement of people every year .
at its meeting on 2 march , the council of environment ministers gave broad policy orientations in relation to the future development of the thematic strategy .
but i suspect there is a deeper plot here .
i am happy to see that the commission ' s declaration is a little more stringent in stating that , when the common agricultural policy is reviewed in 2002 , greater emphasis should be placed on quality than on quantity .
we have not taken into account the californian experience , price volatility or the inadequacy of long-term contracts .
as spokesperson for the socialist group in the human rights sub-committee , i must congratulate the commission on this aspect of its proposal , although other points of it can clearly be improved , particularly those which provide for rigid mechanisms for the preferences established for the less developed countries .
i do not think anyone in this chamber is in any doubt about the catastrophic scale of the darfur tragedy , just as there can not be any doubt that it really is genocide .
many of them told me that they were willing to make an effort , particularly in terms of preserving stocks .
the ratio of profits to gdp is at what is nearly its highest level in the last 25 years .
mr president , mr president-in-office , the middle east chessboard has always served as a test bench for european diplomacy , which as yet has failed to adopt a unified political approach .
there is also the european external action service , to make a difference in haiti , and the action plan for the area of freedom , security and justice .
harmonization in the construction industry is therefore necessary because it will ease the mobility of professionals , tradesmen and building contractors , making it possible for them to undertake projects in other member states .
many aspects of the proposal have met with broad support and we should build on these .
the commission has put forward a different proposal here .
parliament 's delegation for relations between the european union and ukraine is in permanent contact with those concerned and is prepared to help .
secondly , i believe nuclear weapons pose such a threat to all of us that it is legitimate and indeed essential to use all peaceful avenues open to us to try to rid our countries of them .
it also needs to be stressed that the fundamental rights agency is something about which parliament is engaged in talks with both the commission and the council , and in these we have endeavoured to get the agency a clearly delineated mandate .
it is another philosophy the lack of jobs for so many european citizens is also costly .
i therefore believe we must be extremely careful .
i do not think , commissioner , that turkey can accede via a process to destroy cyprus and anyone who wants to help turkey needs to stop taking it out on cyprus .
this really is the most appropriate time , when we are discussing the future of our fisheries policy on the basis of four reports , for the commission to make this statement .
we now have an opportunity to encourage diversification .
we need a firm line on this because the unemployment rate is a catastrophe for human beings and the economy .
that would seem almost impossible , given the multitude of tasks , as many here have said , but let me point out quite firmly that no doubts must be voiced - and especially not in vienna , prior to the handover of the presidency - about whether it will be possible to keep to the agenda 2000 timetable in the first six months .
i have two short questions . you have given here an impressive description of the model which you call the new model of competition , of fair competition .
on the contrary , we believe that , whether the report or the common position wishes it or not , these regulations make it easier for oligopolies and monopolies to lay their hands on these biotechnological discoveries and inventions and to apply them on behalf - always - of their own unregulated and inhuman profit .
ladies and gentlemen , if we wait that long there will not be any railways left in europe that are operated on a commercial basis .
the dates for the entry into force of these legislative acts have been selected for two reasons : to ensure they are applied as quickly as possible and to allow the port authorities to set up control capabilities where the port state is responsible for controls .
because the terms under which the candidate countries are able to meet the conditions for membership vary , some kind of selection takes place automatically .
in its final decision , the commission stated that , with regard to the power generation and transport sectors , the restructuring plan was adequate to ensure industrial recovery .
the sad fact is that the longer this dreadful situation continues the fewer moderates there are going to be , but they show considerable courage in their own communities and they deserve our continuing support .
that will offer the opportunity to individualise transfers .
she has called on the commission to develop a kind of roadmap , which , while it has not been discussed in this house officially , will nevertheless guide us in tackling the difficult topic of bse and tse in the future .
there is one point which we are not entirely happy about .
finally , have those member states that have regularised the status of huge numbers of their illegal immigrants in recent years got on top of illegal immigration in their countries ?
there is always a vying between these two groups .
the impetus for the fire protection programme and the evaluation carried out in all the european union countries has been positive , especially in the most affected , like spain , portugal , italy and france and , in part , germany too .
thus , in states such as spain , italy or france , the charges are approved by their parliament and , in these cases , it is the authority responsible for investigating appeals to laws which must act as the independent supervisory authority .
yet some ministers - not all - would have preferred there to be no proposal at all .
without pluralism , there is no opposition , no freedom and , therefore , no democracy .
no amount of linguistic acrobatics can hide the fact that the french and the dutch people clearly stated their opposition to the draft constitution .
but before us is a clear , substantive proposal .
will the council react to this sort of breach of basic human rights ?
and lastly , how can staff mobility between institutions be encouraged if parliament and the commission have different career structures ?
such matters should , in my opinion , ideally be negotiated at company level .
for obvious reasons , so that farmers can decide how to prepare their soil for sowing , they must know by 30 june each year the set-aside rate for the following year .
first of all , if you allow me , i have here a note in french .
this is no doubt related to the region 's economic vulnerability , but also to geographical factors .
at the same time , they must also be as flexible as possible , in order not to impose needless restrictions on businesses in the border regions and on the people who live there .
it is necessary to strengthen both the interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary facets of education and research programmes and cooperation between universities .
more and more innovative and life-saving drugs are counterfeit .
the rapporteur also recognises that on one side of an invisible border are the citizens and on the other people with no papers who are forced into resorting to illegal methods .
i am having a quick look in the direction of the commissioner , since we are not really short of time .
i am greatly concerned by the confusion surrounding the 2011 eu budget since , on the one hand , we can not abandon our ambitious plans to build a strong european union , while , on the other , poland will take over the presidency of the eu council in the second half of 2011 .
it is with a certain degree of concern that i note the continuing high percentage of such complaints .
council regulations relating to the introduction of the euro have a single objective : to give legal security to operators in their financial and commercial operations throughout the process of introducing the euro and the progressive disappearance of national currencies both before and after 1 january 1999 .
by way of a response to the council’s proposal for a directive , which was characterised by nothing more than the desire to keep refugees out , the report enshrines in law a number of glaring deficiencies .
a call for proposals was published on 3 september this year , on the theme of food agriculture and fisheries biotechnology , on the identification of emerging honey bee pests and diseases , and the re-emergence of pathogens , aimed at elucidating the intimate mechanisms and reasons for the increased honey bee mortality .
this is simply not true .
now it is time to act .
co2 emissions are a cross-border problem and require a european approach .
however , it is a good thing that i do not have to speak bulgarian .
russia still has a lot of catching up to do in terms of its economy .
the robin hood campaign is an interesting one and i think there should be an 80:20 split within it ; 80 % going to public services and 20 % to making sure we have a fund to ensure that the banking crisis does not happen again .
with this in mind , the european union has pioneered legislation in the field of environmental protection and has also been a key partner in international negotiations and agreements on the global protection of the planet .
looking back , i should like to point out that the president of the french republic , mr chirac , was strongly advised to stop the initial text , which was presented , at the time , by the prodi commission .
that is why our parliament is calling for a study of the possibility of reducing working hours in accordance with the rocard report , which was approved by our parliament .
our proposals are not a reflection of an abstract scheme and are not a luxury , but reflect objective , inescapable requirements for a comprehensive reform of the institutions of the union .
major technological breakthroughs and key discoveries need to be based on a constant stream of minor innovations , and at present this is not happening .
naturally , we will be assisted in this task by the european institute for gender equality , which , from next week - and this is another symbol , which comes at exactly the same time as the meeting is being held in new york - will be established permanently in vilnius .
finally , we must not become stressed .
indeed , in the present climate where american airlines enjoy massive financial handouts , tax breaks and state aid , it is grossly unfair to expect europe 's airlines to survive , let alone compete , when they are currently compelled to pay for new increased security measures .
the complex relationship between international humanitarian law and the definition of terrorism may lead to further complications .
commissioner hahn agreed that the mechanism was complex and difficult to implement .
i agree that there is a need to have a debate on this .
( the oral amendment was accepted )
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports on criminal matters and sentences :
not for the first time do i want to put on the record that in all of this sorry debacle , farmers were the innocent victims of circumstances which were beyond their control .
this agreement on civil aviation safety , concluded between the eu and canada , follows the horizontal agreement already adopted by parliament in march 2011 .
exactly what approach is this committee to adopt ?
the commission is therefore between 500 % and 2 000 % below what all these international reports are telling us .
i will simply add that the farmers’ welfare is also a noble cause and , in our view , a high-priority cause .
president mubarak must step down now .
thirdly , instead of merely considering how to share out the existing workload among more people , the member states must launch education and training campaigns .
the internet and mobile phones are a wonderful , exciting opportunity .
the institutions are blaming each other .
– mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the importance of young people’s involvement in society can not be overemphasised .
in historic terms , these are something quite different ; they represent the abandonment of cold war-style deterrence in favour of the active waging of war – a disaster waiting to happen .
indeed , judging by mr casaca 's tone , he is positively affronted to find that the law of a member state should ever prevail over the commission : heaven forbid !
we must denounce the lobbying by unscrupulous laboratories and the multinational companies who represent them .
what on earth can you do with ecu 11 million per annum ?
as far as the future of the information society is concerned the latter objective is the more crucial one .
the call that we , the non-violent radical party , would like to make to you is to take into consideration the urgent need , once again , for the united states of europe , opening up to membership , to members , and not to confused relations of partnership .
i believe we can take pride in having in fact done more than we undertook to do .
i am very much in sympathy with your suggestions . we must certainly heed your comments about democratic control in areas which we have always traditionally felt - and i am sure rightly so - are subject to the law-making process .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , commissioner , the debate on reducing greenhouse gases is like a never-ending story .
we voted in favour of the report on a single market for enterprises and growth .
it states that everything done with regard to the common european security and defence policy must be carried out in accordance with the principles of the un charter .
the strengthening of basic rights , the recognition of the role of services of general public interest , which is an essential component of our european model of society , and the tightening of measures to combat fraud are all positive points that can be welcomed .
i am also counting very much on parliament 's support in this matter .
in particular , my report calls for a pilot project and associated research to investigate whether the norwegian system of banning all discards could assist in preserving stocks of one or more particularly at-risk species .
therefore , they deferred any decision on this issue until after parliament had discussed the issue .
a revised lisbon strategy ?
it will , of course , just be a new beginning for coordinated action at eu and national level for helping this truly european minority .
mrs wallis summed up excellently what this is ultimately about .
it is positive because its procedures and timeframes are fast ; positive because it is aimed at highly qualified project categories ; positive because it is aimed at urban contexts , in other words , at local authorities which , by making specific decisions , are able to bring about real change in the state of affairs and improve air quality , housing quality and urban transport quality ; positive because it is aimed at profitable projects and can therefore yield a return of resources ; and positive , lastly , because the strategy will bring many more resources into play .
long live freedom , long live our free and democratic country ...
in writing . - ( ro ) i voted for this report because it emphasises the importance of increasing the allocation of european funds for research , aimed at implementing new technologies for capturing greenhouse gases , especially co2 , particularly funds aimed at implementing pilot projects which will raise the profile of this research , along with the opportunities offered by it and the safety of new technologies .
another thing we wanted to be considered before an attack was made was the internal tensions that would be triggered in iraq .
this partner institution of the un human rights convention is an indispensable place of refuge for tibetans who are obliged to flee their homeland .
question no 40 by roy perry ( h-0732/97 )
patients should be subjects , not the objects of a marketing campaign .
that focus has been lost .
but i would like to add a rider to that by saying that it is absolutely essential that individual nation states should have the right to determine their own rate of vat .
the vote will take place on wednesday at 11.30 a.m .
education also plays a very significant role in combating this problem .
these wage differences , which are not chosen but are , rather , dictated by the wage conditions in the market , must be eliminated if families are to be able freely to choose the pattern of family life that suits them .
if political accord can be reached this year within the council of ministers on the basis of this partnership solution , then this will also be good for european employment policy .
a further problem area is parliament ' s still inadequate participation in the legislative procedures concerning competition .
we are all concerned about brominated flame retardants .
we must respond now , together .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the difficulties which the commission 's original proposal met along the way are a very clear example of the difficulties which are going to crop up in the budgetary debate over this year .
at the same time as we gave our assent , we expressed four expectations .
this was discussed in the debate in guimarães in which i participated during the meeting of ministers for employment and social affairs .
this option accords with established procedures and ensures proper scrutiny .
we also have the schengen agreements .
we also need to try and act in a way where we are becoming more objective in these matters in europe .
applause
i do not seek to second-guess the doubtless well-intentioned interpretations of others or to undermine efforts to make the most of the present , exceptionally difficult , situation .
on the one hand they get paid less for the same job , and on the other their shorter period of employment because of the responsibilities of motherhood are both reasons for the poverty of women when they reach retirement age .
accordingly i have voted against this report .
that is why the media programme , which was presented in july 2004 , has been provided with a budget of over eur 1 billion .
there have been improvements since then however , which is why we do grant discharge to the economic and social committee for 1998 , 1999 and 2000 .
the provisions on forestry aid in the agenda 2000 reforms are worded very unclearly , and it is thus difficult to discover what they mean , for example , in terms of funding .
mrs lynne has spontaneously offered to take it to england too .
then there is this brave attempt to remove trade barriers between these two major trading blocs .
however , it was not long before the member states ' national courts had to deal with disputes challenging community law on the grounds of human rights .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , there are two fundamental requirements in our approach to the problems raised by recent developments in the democratic republic of congo .
this is fundamental to the conduct of a truly single monetary policy .
as was also announced by the european commission in january , ambitious plans are in the pipeline for the galileo project .
in the past , as a representative of an export company , i experienced these difficulties on the ground and i believe that the proposal in question will help to remedy them .
( bg ) my answer was very specific according to the standards of the commission .
mr president , i welcome the fact that we are debating services of general interest once again , on the occasion of the commission 's statement .
as regards iran , we confirmed our attention to the deadline of the end of october established by the board of governors of the international atomic energy agency for the country to implement specific guarantees with regard to its nuclear programme .
above all we want to see fair and even-handed implementation of any measures that are agreed upon .
in the face of economic uncertainty in the labour market , the economic policies of the member states need to be discussed and coordinated in order to boost the economy , make the margins for budgetary action more flexible and to promote cohesion and the european social model .
tighter controls on the airline carriers ' financial situation , especially in the case of low-cost companies , a tighter control on mergers and takeovers , as well as setting up a sizeable guarantee fund , are a few of the solutions which could , in the long term , offer passengers protection in the event of airline bankruptcy .
energy policy development should always take stock of local conditions .
an additional eur 60 million was made available to romania and bulgaria between 2004 and 2006 , under the pre-accession instruments .
‘then you must say no to turkey joining the european union , ’ he remarked , and then continued , ‘but if turkey does join the european union , will it at last put an end to islamic terrorism ? ’
i wanted to take this opportunity to ask the minister whether there is any discussion in the council over the issue of minimum pricing of alcohol products .
it is important not to stop at the external borders of the european union .
i urge the president and vice-president of the commission , particularly in the course of their work over the coming months , to ensure that the interinstitutional agreement is consistently implemented in this context .
mr funk , i think it is a little convenient to put your trust in the chronic generosity of the commission 's agricultural spending forecasts , which looks like turning up again in 1997 as well and in the end all the adjustments will be made painlessly in 1998 .
they sink back deeper in their deck chairs and tan themselves in complacency believing europe 's most successful industry needs neither help nor understanding .
they were elected to represent , in a european context , the interests of their people , and thus of their nation states .
the commission therefore remains convinced that the transitional period of more than seven years granted to the duty-free sector was sufficient to meet the duty-free trade 's legitimate concern about the phasing out of such sales .
ratification of the decision on own resources in the various member states is going well , and we hope to be in a position to achieve the objective of its full and comprehensive entry into force by 1 january 2009 .
the council was amazed at the enormity of the proposal : commission officials , without batting an eyelid - although for them it was a natural thing to do - were asking the council to grant them the power to impose sanctions on the member states .
commitments must be honoured both at community level and by the member states of the european union .
.
it is an issue on which i myself have yet to come down on one side of or the other .
.
unlike the other areas in which the treaty has undergone substantial amendments , marine biological resources are not solely the institutional concern of politicians .
subject : intercultural dialogue in eu
again , i would report to this house that there was a formal discussion amongst the permanent representatives of the issue of transparency on 19 october .
in exceptional cases , however , the eu may authorise the member state to enter into bilateral agreements : if the community has no interest in agreements with the third country , if the individual member state has a particular interest in the agreement and the agreement does not negatively impact community law .
the kuhne report calls for even more rearmament in order to ensure that the eu , relying on nato capacities , can intervene militarily across the globe .
what is more , the various liberal ideas that are currently in vogue , which include viewing health care as a service and a market commodity and making it more difficult to acquire specialist qualifications , as well as the various economic programmes that advocate job cuts at the expense of health-care systems and that merely improve the economic situation of private medical centres , will not solve the growing number of problems we face in the health-care sector or create new jobs .
obviously , this also applies to israel .
madam president , commissioner , is it not the case that the previous greek government amassed a huge debt potential , and that is why greece now has problems fulfilling the stability and growth pact ?
obviously , there has to be a discussion in nato about how this system should fit into other systems that nato intends to develop . that is absolutely essential .
i also wanted to start in a country as commissioner doing field trips , a country that i knew well already in order to better be able to assess how the commission works .
those basic safeguards must be restored .
i hope that just looking at the situation actually produces some results , because we must get a solution !
mr president , the fact that today , throughout central and western europe , we have democracy , civil liberties , private ownership and tolerance is due to the fact that communism did not take hold on our continent , although it could have .
( lt ) i agree with the commission and my fellow members who have said that the situation in yemen is tense .
the second world war claimed the lives of 20 million soviet citizens , who served with the red army , starved in the siege of leningrad , and were forced to labour as slaves .
we could have hoped for an energy treaty like the euratom treaty .
so , there is a job that needs doing .
in this first speech i have been asked to give you some brief information about operation artemis , the operation currently being carried out by the european union in the democratic republic of the congo , in the region of ituri and more specifically in the city of bunia .
if one wishes to achieve harmonisation , however , the policy should instead take account of national differences and be adapted to the national structures .
as you are aware , the european union , through the european commission humanitarian office echo , is by far the largest donor of humanitarian aid to the northern caucasus .
we need to make it quite clear to russia that aggression does not pay .
competition is not about out-competing others .
there is no such thing as european public opinion .
these are our priorities .
that evaluation should analyse the functions of the agency and indicate whether it should take on other responsibilities relating to aspects of border management .
the problem is : how do women break through the glass ceiling that the questioner has recognised ?
mr president , commissioner , i would like to thank the rapporteur for a comprehensive and balanced report , which is exceptionally significant in today 's world .
however , i agree with mr hegyi that we need to take action with regard to land .
the stand against turkey is a most important issue which will be discussed , within the framework of enlargement , at the european council summit in december .
all development efforts are a waste of time if the objectives of trade , monetary and other policies undermine or contradict them .
it is better to increase the amount of clean and fresh drinking water available by desalinating sea water than by digging deeper for ground water or by redirecting rivers to storage reservoirs .
i wonder whether it would not be better for everybody if the british just were not part of this european union .
if not , what does the european union plan to do to ensure that these observers , who i would stress are extremely important , are there for the elections in june ?
the revision of the directive on food may help to significantly change this situation .
this should be done through the use of the iberian region - spain and portugal , where i come from - as a fundamental platform in terms of logistics and distribution in the european area .
i would add that as a result of access to acp countries , these countries have the right to bid on anything we tender relating to them .
for that reason , it is right for the french government to highlight the importance of giving aid to the maghreb countries , many of whose citizens are settled in london , which i represent , as migrants or refugees .
here too , the ‘’ rule applies , and neither the commission nor this house – perhaps not even a majority in the latter – should venture to exert pressure by making appeals to one country or another .
this is the only way to support a process ; this is the only way for smart , strategic diplomacy to support this country on the path to democracy .
just as i stated earlier , this house pays no more than lip service to the principle of subsidiarity .
as a result of pressure from europe , it was also agreed that the special representatives should meet regularly . these individuals are resident in the area .
this is an all-party request that we are making to the council this evening .
the document must remain readable for the citizens , not just for meps or specialists- and it is not yet completely so , if i have understood mr turco correctly .
this will allow the issue to be raised again in november and give the council a few more months to consider whether or not transparency is better than secrecy .
someone should tell mrs wallström ...
- a6-0149/2005 by mrs mato adrover , on behalf of the committee on employment and social affairs , on the proposal for a council decision on guidelines for the employment policies of the member states ;
there is still a choice to be made , and last-minute policy shifts from the commission do nothing to restore the confidence of the disconnected .
the aim of the european union solidarity fund ( eusf ) is to provide swift , effective and flexible assistance to the population of a member state , or a country negotiating accession , in the event of a major natural disaster .
you must legalise your responsibilities and i call on you to do this as a matter of urgency .
i agree that we need to establish a true base for future european energy policy , aimed at pursuing the objectives of security of supply , combating climate change and the economic growth of the european union .
madam president , commissioner , mrs prets , i have listened quite carefully to what our commissioner has said .
the first point is closely bound up with the forthcoming international conferences , the most important of which will be that scheduled to take place in kyoto , about which most speakers had something to say .
this is the only way of boosting the funds and helping them to stabilise their finances .
it has almost always been necessary for the discriminated person to prove unfair treatment , but of course it would have been better if we could have gone just a little further and perhaps , as we heard earlier , included article 4.1c which was present in the commission 's proposal .
i also very much endorse the progressive europeanisation - yes , let us call it that - of current security policy and of the military intervention in the balkans .
the police and judicial authorities of our respective states must therefore receive adequate resources to combat this plague which affects the most vulnerable of us . in this area which is cross-border in nature , it may be useful for the european union to make its own contribution .
during the discussions at first reading , i already indicated that the line of reasoning was rather weak .
i do not apologise , however , for the time that we have needed .
moreover , we will need to work on an own resource for the eu budget .
this report particularly emphasises the need to maintain the predominant status of the cross-border pillar and to develop incentives to spur on large cross-border and transnational projects , such as the trans-european transport networks ( ten-t ) .
this is all wonderful but , mr president , our standpoint would lead to improvement in the long term .
the commission is also funding numerous technical assistance projects with an impact on human rights , ranging from , for instance , improving police training to modernising the judicial system in partner countries .
the commissioner is well aware of the contents of the report and probably could recite them as well as i could .
i have pleasure in informing you that this year we again sponsored a resolution on intolerance based on religion or belief which was adopted by consensus in the un third committee .
although it contains certain aspects that i consider contradictory , i agree with the report when it highlights the lack of coherence between un policy – as defined in the beijing platform for action – and eu policy on equal opportunities .
the involvement and support of all the community institutions , including the european parliament , is essential to raise the profile of this initiative and to ensure its effective delivery and to guarantee its eventual success .
there are over 6 billion of us , and what was once an extreme phenomenon and went unnoticed is , today , evident .
i think that no one here wishes to see this budget reduced .
the commission shares your concerns , and we will maintain our strong enforcement activities in these fields in close cooperation with the national competition authorities .
it shows amazing arrogance towards europe’s voters .
the date of 31 december 2012 for member states that joined the union in 2004 seems unnecessarily distant .
the problem facing us at the moment is whether there is currently a consensus within the european union on this issue being included , particularly bearing in mind that if one such issue is included , other issues of a similar nature will probably be added to the conference ' s agenda .
innocent people are being shot , stabbed and beaten to death with increasing frequency .
practically , could that be considered , and could we have a comment back in the announcement at 12 o'clock , please ?
in order to optimize the relationship with the united states , the following priorities could be set : the new transatlantic agenda , especially the lifting of barriers to trade ; harmonization in new areas such as the environment , health and energy ; solving trade differences by both the united states and the european union whilst respecting the who pronouncements ; and finally , drawing the line against evil regimes , without european countries putting their own trade interests first , with the risk that the european union and the united states are played off against each other .
the council stated that the legal proceedings against aung san suu kyi represented a crime against national and international law .
for example , many people still believe that we can play off freedom and security against one another , although we know that freedom is only effective when we protect it .
that should be borne in mind by everyone in a position of responsibility in every country !
in my country - i live in the north of spain - , there is a considerable difference between the north and the south , and difficulties arise when we have to transfer water from one place to another .
this is , however , an important subject , affecting areas that the union is considering , such as the protection of natural resources and the relaunch of the development policy , as well as the new objectives for agriculture and fisheries , for example .
in 2003 the social partners agreed on a general framework , which fulfils these requirements .
the committee on citizens ' freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs feels that a number of the proposed measures are too dependent on the goodwill of individual member states and it calls for rules at a european level .
the focus this year has been very much on women and children .
those are the implicit and explicit conclusions reached at the united nations itself by the great majority of those governments which participated in the 1991 gulf war coalition .
there are simply too many gaps which affect ordinary citizens who want to travel and to work in other member states - even things like registering a motor vehicle in a number of member states .
nevertheless , i am still persuaded that it is possible to achieve real , serious democracy at european level , albeit not , of course , in such a manner as this .
moreover , europe is still the main destination for tourists from third countries , even though it faces increasingly stiff competition and an increasingly diversified and attractive range of products .
the patient was so angry about his illness that he shot the doctor , but you will understand , mr president-in-office , that i feel rather nervous when i see that it is precisely the governments that are once again gathering around europe’s sickbed .
many of those people are going to be the engines of growth and jobs in the future in the european union .
should we shift the emphasis away from budgetary consolidation , or even amend the stability pact ?
additional agricultural expenditure will be necessary , as a result of the bse crisis , which will be substantial ; however we quite rightly do not wish to revise the whole financial perspective adopted in 1999 .
upholding european social models is one of our priorities in an increasingly globalised world .
and we also have a very strong proposal to put to the european commission asking it to begin an interinstitutional enquiry , with the help of scientific committees , to determine if tobacco companies incorporate additives in tobacco to increase the addiction to nicotine .
we must say to the authorities , in the name of human rights , in the name of respect for libya , ‘release them ! ’
the commission believes that the eligibility criteria for mobilisation have been met , particularly , in madeira 's case , as regards the threshold for damage .
this was a very disappointing development in my view and so i really hope that the commission and parliament are in a position to convince the portuguese council presidency that we need to go a little further than is the case at present .
it would be deeply damaging to all those in libya who are continuing to fight for their rights , democracy , sovereignty and peace , and would introduce serious elements of instability and conflict into the region .
i refer to the council 's conclusions , which leave little space for a concrete change of approach to create a competitive and competition-based energy market .
the union must assist the candidates for accession to establish and develop socially orientated administrative and organizational infrastructures .
businesses are collapsing , and for the fourth consecutive year our gnp has decreased .
that is why it is important to ensure , in particular , that all of the parties involved can actually participate in the work of these bodies .
it seems to me that the only way to overcome the problem of pesticide residues in food is to avoid using pesticides in farming .
in reality , we know that the people of europe do not want more supranationalism .
independent market operators means independent workshops , motoring organisations and breakdown rescue services .
i hope i am not pressurising you unduly on this friday morning .
parliament has consistently expressed the view that this concept obviously includes the right of free movement without frontier controls between the countries of the european union , or the european community as it was then .
i really consider it an incredible absurdity when the commission argues that we are passing on the data , but that the protection of our citizens ' fundamental rights will remain , as the usa has promised to guarantee the same level of data protection as we enjoy in europe .
therefore , these three points are crucial for me .
we need to support them in transforming their facilities and give them time to complete that process , thus preventing farms from suffering irreparable damage and preventing an overnight shortage in the eu market , which will consequently increase prices for consumers .
the simplicity with which american private investors can buy shares and the new opportunities offered by electronic commerce are trends that europe has to follow .
.
in the council’s defence , i must say , however , that an attempt has now at least been made to get rid of some of the silliest aspects of the legislation .
it is very important for an objective and thoroughly considered basis for a decision to be established with regard to this matter .
owing to the nature of the portuguese sugar industry , and in order to keep it viable , we consider it essential to maintain national subsidies to portuguese sugar-beet producers in addition to the framework laid out by the commission .
this will create a climate conducive to restarting the vital roadmap for peace talks .
deficits in education and training , after all , lead almost automatically to economic slippage and social problems .
request for the waiver of parliamentary immunity : see minutes
on its own initiative , the american supreme court has decided to investigate whether american jurisdiction should also apply to the guantánamo naval base , and a response is awaited by no later than june of this year .
i have taken note of mrs ferrer 's wish , and i am all the more in agreement with her because it is important that the commission be able to target these measures at ad hoc companies , for if not , we will see aid being scattered , and allocated less efficiently .
given that the un security council has primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security , close cooperation must be established between the eu and the un in the area of civilian and military crisis management and , in particular , in humanitarian relief operations where the united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs ( unocha ) is in the lead role .
to turn the argument round , before dismantling anything we must first think about where to put it , and since we do not know that yet , the decommissioned nuclear plants should be safely sealed off , naturally without removing the fuel rods ; these should stay in the plant , so that a stop can be put to this senseless practice of transporting them around europe .
its citizens must have the right to their own language and culture .
the next item on the agenda is the commission 's statement on the fine imposed on the french football federation following its infringement of the european legislation on competition .
opening of the sitting
its sole objective is to increase the unfair aspects of the cap and to channel further financial resources into production which is already swallowing up 45 % of all aid which is losing more jobs and leading to more desertification in the community .
there was the determination to impose on the europeans by political pressure the boeing-mcdonnell douglas merger , tied up with contracts of exclusivity in one form or another , and american food standards in the fields of hormonetreated meat , genetically modified organisms , and the quality of bananas .
the commission report itself is relatively thorough , and the commission has clearly responded to parliament 's request for greater speed and urgency in producing it , although it is regrettable that some specific comments made by parliament in its report last year have still not been taken into account , particularly with regard to information on hearings .
after all , presumably we are still a part of the budgetary authority !
in effect , this is not interference ; rather , we are supporting the democrats , and i hope that everyone here in this house understands , precisely because credibility is becoming easier to win every day and in every case .
according to the estimate of the international energy agency , there may be up to 991 billion cubic metres of non-traditional gas reserves in europe .
i shall firstly give them the floor , as is customary .
the european commission also agreed to help us in this regard .
the person with the big idea of having a constitution was the then bavarian prime minister , graf montgelas , who did himself great credit by establishing a french administration in bavaria .
this is why the group of the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe supports this helpful compromise , which makes an agreement with the council at second reading possible .
by 31 july this year , 90 % of the recruitment targets from new member states had been fulfilled .
if you give me the ball to kick off , i am sure i will not stop until i score a goal !
i do , however , support the creation of a post of commissioner for human rights and minorities , who would also be responsible for protecting the rights of children .
a statute for political parties is needed to define their rights and obligations , and to allow them to become legal entities .
the tóraidhe were anglo-irish people who were expelled from their land on account of their religion .
we have also tried to improve rail access between brussels and strasbourg with the deviation via roissy and a link between thalys and the tgv .
but we must build up this side of things ; if the commissioner really shows us that he and his commission , with the support of the council , are taking a first step in the direction parliament wishes , then i believe we have the opportunity to enter a new phase together .
in writing . - ( pt ) this recast relating to the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment ( rohs ) is necessary , according to the commission , because of uncertainty with regard to scope , a lack of clarity with regard to legal provisions , and disparities among member states with regard to the conformity of the products in question .
in recent years , the world has been tragically hit by disasters such as tsunamis , earthquakes in pakistan and the recent flooding in bangladesh .
on the contrary , matters are being simplified . it is only logical , however , for motorcyclists to be given some degree of training .
in response , i would therefore like to have the commission 's opinion on these proposals and also on the level of funds committed , because we have not been given many details in this respect .
of course the green group supports kofi annan .
i also support the proposition for member states that create bigger risk by their deficits and debt burden to contribute more to the assets of the crisis mechanism because this would definitely encourage strict fiscal discipline and enhance the added value of having a proper economic and fiscal policy .
turning to amendment no 19 , we believe that , quite apart from the unnecessary increase in red tape generated by the establishment of independent institutes , the principle of subsidiarity must prevail ; as regards the competent national bodies to which you refer , it should be remembered that these are not defined in law , do not have a common status and do not exist everywhere .
i think that he has done a brilliant job of handling this discharge exercise .
we did not object to this for it marked a huge step forward , also in view of the fact that this is an important condition which we will soon be able to apply to the candidate countries .
i would like to point out that we have major problems with biodiversity here in europe , something which far too few people are aware of .
how much control do european institutions have over the subsidies and advantages gained by private companies such as telefónica or others , and what control is there over the use that these companies make of them ?
the main aim of this directive is to extend the scope of this issue , which undermines the protection of the financial interests of the member states , and this is clearly something that we must reject .
but there are lots of other issues for the fishing industry .
approval of minutes of previous sitting : see minutes
as we remember and celebrate that our european union and this parliament have so successfully expanded to welcome new members of our family , i say to eu member states from eastern europe now that we will not walk away from you at any time of need .
however , there is something that will certainly contribute to better quality of life in the rural areas , and especially the situation of women there .
in 1998 the growth of the community budget in payments is 1.4 % .
we must facilitate access to european markets and allow greater mobility .
the agreement must be strong enough to combat the challenge of climate change and , at the same time , it must be balanced and fair with regard to developing countries .
we do not therefore support the second and third points of paragraph 16 .
with interruptions such as this , however , the debate becomes more interesting .
with regard to the resolutions on cariforum - the only full economic partnership agreement ( epa ) - i call upon members to support the original text of the committee on international trade .
we believe that the amendments adopted by the committee on international trade constitute a basis for finding such a solution .
poverty and the european union .
you tell us that you are trying to be open but that you have limited room for manoeuvre .
we must also say quite clearly , and i should like to stress this to the commission , what we do not want .
that should be supported .
mr president , the next eu-us summit will prove a historic one , and i fully support the german presidency 's initiative for an extensive economic partnership between the eu and the united states , which now represents some 40 % of world trade , and in particular chancellor merkel 's ambitious aim for a transatlantic market without barriers by 2015 through mutual recognition of the same norms for various industries and services , particularly in the financial sector .
we call on the commission to keep the promise it made to this house that eu action will cover all areas of discrimination .
at the same time , it must impose without hesitation tough sanctions against any anti-democratic stance or violation of human rights and freedoms .
we can only seize the material at the last station in the territory of the member states .
i am sure that the dg on transport and energy has a copy of the uk 's road safety strategy that was published in march 2000 .
we have first hand accounts from tamil families and people who are in europe and who are always sending us messages and accounts of what is happening to them and what is happening to their families trapped in the conflict between the tamil tigers and the sri lankan army .
the specific features of european agriculture were not taken into consideration , and in its determination to get into line with the international agricultural model , the commission failed to define a true european agriculture model which took into consideration the specific nature of our rural development and land use .
the commission , however , has relegated the public sector to the role of poor relation and market legislation to the role of basic regulator .
public service broadcasting must remain available to all citizens .
( fr ) mr president , commissioner , i would refer to the working document of mrs mccarthy and mrs wallis .
the fact is that the president-in-office of the council has already made this commitment in a letter to the president of parliament , but we will still have to uphold it when the time comes to negotiate .
we are now seeing a glimpse of a new opportunity to reach a peace agreement with the maoist guerrillas , which had previously declared genuine ceasefires which were rejected by the king ; now , however , the ceasefire has been accepted .
companies need a strong message that they also benefit from voluntary labour and we must make best-practice comparisons as to how voluntary activity can continue to be made attractive , so that we can achieve our goals .
of course , there are still some ambiguities , and of course we should have liked to go further , but still .
as you will be aware , there are already in force five basic directives that tackle these issues , and the european parliament was both prompt and forward-looking in the way in which it cooperated in their drafting . the directive we are today considering covers aspects that have yet to be broached : the right of reproduction , the right of communication to the public , the right of distribution and protection of the means of identifying and protecting works and therefore combating rampant piracy .
this fact is perhaps less a reflection of the current political composition of parliament than of the image of the power held by socialists across the fifteen member states .
in writing . - ( pt ) although this report contains certain aspects which , despite being moderate , we regard as positive , it does not effectively tackle the major funding issues .
from this point of view , i welcome the rejection in committee of the dogmatic amendments tabled by the greens , based on scientific guess-work and ideological prejudice .
this means that we need to strengthen the union before we enlarge it , and the amsterdam summit certainly helped to do that .
it is not acceptable that the police in portugal can only access the bank details of a person on the basis of a warrant but that millions of pieces of data can be sent to be interpreted and analysed by the us police without any judicial control .
member states and the other interested parties agree on the long-term objectives and the instruments to be used .
both sides of the atlantic agree that equivalence , rather than strict convergence , will be a suitable outcome .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , may i start by reminding the house that the principle of subsidiarity has to be respected in structural policy .
in the last few months , an escalating wave of attacks on humanitarian workers , peace activists and human rights defenders has been sweeping southern and central somalia .
( pl ) mr president , i would like to draw attention to two questions in this debate , questions which in my view cast a shadow on the functioning of economic and monetary union .
given the rise in statistically affected regions in scotland , it is now more important than ever that positive measures are taken to ensure that allocated funds are spent effectively and respect the length of the entire programming period .
and another central aspect , for both small and medium-sized enterprises and the craft sector , is international cooperation .
the structural funds have been reinforcing r+d structures on the basis of a territorial distribution of resources by means of convergence criteria .
the civilian populations and , in particular , women , are the main victims of the conflict strategies employed by the armed groups and even , as someone said , by certain units of the congolese army , which have made systematic rape a weapon of war .
when discussing china , we should always bear in mind the foundations on which this house , and the entire european union , are built .
if initially , however , we first sort out saddam hussein , perhaps for oil , without having taken and carried out any initiative in the middle east , we will not be credible and we will not create greater justice in the world .
together with the council ' s determination to arrive quickly at a common position , the report has helped with the efficient reading of the commission ' s proposal .
it may be true that an agreement was not far off in brussels .
these cuts are part of efforts to exit the crisis .
the first is that enlargement is only possible if the agricultural and structural policies are reformed .
( nl ) i should now like to turn to another topic , namely enlargement .
the public health argument , that is , that higher prices reduce smoking , has also been wheeled out .
it was the result of the free coming together of 11 governments who believed in the creation of an economic and monetary union , as laid down in the treaties , as an essential step in attempting to achieve the political union that still unfortunately remains out of our grasp .
mr president , i should like to start by thanking the european parliament , especially , the rapporteur , mrs paliadeli , and the shadow rapporteurs , for their solid support for the commission 's proposal on the european heritage label .
the interim agreement states that bilateral issues must not be allowed to become a barrier to accession .
i am also pleased that parliament largely agrees that other aspects - in particular , prevention and re-use - should be further studied before new decisions are taken .
i voted in favour of this resolution which calls for democracy to be restored in the republic of côte d'ivoire ( ivory coast ) following the presidential elections which took place on 28 november 2010 .
we keep running around in circles ; we have not been able to take a step towards objectivity for millennia .
the deadline for tabling amendments is 12 noon on wednesday .
it is not a matter of gaining time , mr weber .
the last outpost - like hitler in his berlin bunker , as it were - of terrorists in the world at the moment is afghanistan .
now then , i can not understand this parliament for complaining about the council 's behaviour .
the other committees directly concerned by this report favour joining kedo and think that parliament should do its job and make that accession possible , including in financial terms .
in fact , for most members it is a side-show when they come to strasbourg ; the average member spends less than five hours in this chamber during a strasbourg week .
a new agreement need not be encyclopaedic , as far as i am concerned , but it must make a number of absolutely essential elements binding on both parties .
the first is similar to mr bourlanges’ question : what practical legislative measures are you considering taking , and what will you do to stop the council blocking such measures , as in the case of your first attempt in 2001 ?
i do think , though , that it is right to review what we have achieved in the balkans , especially in the area where the agency is active , and consider what we have not yet achieved .
my flight is due to leave at 9 p.m. , and before then i also have an important discussion planned with a delegation from the european parliament in connection with the intergovernmental conference .
commissioner , this is not just wishful thinking , it is something which should be reflected in the policies we implement .
the commission 's proposal does just that and i commend it .
we should not be setting up a pollution market , but promoting new environmental development based on cooperation policies that should allow the richer countries to produce while polluting much less and the poorer ones to be helped to develop with access to new environmental technologies .
in addition , households , businesses and the public sector will have considerable comparative economic benefits , as they will have lower energy bills .
we are facing a major problem posed by the lack of adequate port facilities for food-aid deliveries , not least because of the non-availability of the eritrean ports at assab and massawa , which means that only djibouti and to a lesser extent berbera can be used .
our resolution covers many key issues , and i should merely like to draw the house’s attention to a few of them .
the rest will remain anonymous .
the new tax is , by definition , unfair .
perhaps we are rushing things .
i am convinced that our fellow citizens can accept this approach , but on one condition : that we take the trouble to explain to them better the issues at stake in europe .
production , mainly in the growing economies , is in ever greater competition with europe , not only in industry but also in the service sectors .
we have endeavoured , with everybody ' s help , to draft a constructive report based on two lines of approach : the quantitative and the qualitative .
we will all have to work on this , and i will also be transmitting this sentiment to my group .
on the g20 , i will make one main criticism : they have adopted the barroso method , which consists in adding together the existing plans and assuming that that makes a recovery plan .
i have also been glad to note that the majority of the amendments by the committee on the environment have been adopted by the committee responsible .
therefore , i will first give the floor to mr pérez royo for one minute .
the very success of the design of supranational europe , which has guaranteed us - we had better not forget it even now - forty years of peace , stability and democracy , makes the motives that inspired the founding fathers of the community , who had experienced the tragedy of european division and civil war , less urgent and perceptible .
amnestycomplains , for example , that the governments of the union’s member states often do not even take the trouble to reply when it contacts them .
this report gives a clear and comprehensive view of the european ombudsman 's activities in 2008 .
the commission proposals being debated here will give it the face-lift it needs .
indeed , flexicurity is a good principle , as we say in this chamber and in the european institutions .
i put a question to you , commissioner , about the so-called bovine aids , a biv virus which , like the hiv virus , belongs to the retrovirus group .
sweden can take the lead and get others to follow .
