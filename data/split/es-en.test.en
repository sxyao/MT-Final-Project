three subject areas gave rise to lively debate in the committee . for a start , various members demanded that the directive should include reference to parental leave , but mrs niebler has taken the view that the use of this recasting to bring about such a fundamental change in european law is not opportune .
finally , in the present programming period , under the financial instrument for fisheries guidance , member states can co-finance studies and innovative projects covering the specific situation of women shellfish gatherers .
i am also concerned with these issues .
ukraine , georgia and armenia are , however , bound to become members .
this is really a proposal for the legalisation of the us presence .
rapid and uncomplicated cooperation between european partners is required in order to counter the dramatic consequences of the storm xynthia and the devastating torrential rains .
the simple fact is that the member state concerned bears responsibility in each specific case and should indeed exercise this responsibility .
we also talk to members of the public in the eu , but they tell us they want more freedom , they do not want anyone to impose new obligations on them and they do not want politicians to keep interfering in their personal lives .
however , i am confident we can achieve a lot in the coming year .
the enlargement of the eu may indeed require some amendments to existing treaties or new treaties from time to time , but i can not accept that this constitution is required , nor is it desirable at this moment .
the programmes for which financing is approved must be adequately supported by the political authority - the council and parliament - and technically supported by the executive authority , which is the commission .
amendment 1 is therefore withdrawn from the vote .
the work carried out by the commission in cambodia has been positive , as has been the support plan for the elections .
i hope that the rapporteur maintains his proposal to adopt an advisory committee , which would be most appropriate for this type of regulation .
parliamentary dialogue is useful in the context of consolidating democracy and establishing regional integration .
the government ' s various changes of attitude illustrate their embarrassment very well .
( pl ) madam president , today 's debate on the implementation of a european security strategy is one of the more important debates concerning the future of the european union .
my vote in favour of this report reflects the need for a european standard of rights for bus and coach passengers that ensures their comfort , safety and fair treatment as they travel across europe .
i can perhaps once again repeat that the emphasis of emu has really been placed on the monetary aspect but it is obvious - and i should like once again to recall this - that , when we opened the debate on employment , two years ago , more than half the member states thought it was ridiculous that europe should even consider pursuing a genuine employment policy .
against expectations , the convention formula , proposed by this parliament and by our committee on constitutional affairs , was adopted and , against many expectations , it proved to be an unqualified success .
eighteen months have now passed since the last european parliament resolution on east timor .
some of the issues raised by the second initiative are now under negotiation in the council , with regard also to the framework decision concerning the mutual recognition of financial penalties .
finally , a word on aquaculture .
the other states , too , are starting to articulate their claims more strongly .
it is important for this purpose clearly to define the task of the competent european union organisations , so that monitoring can be implemented and restrictions imposed on the illogical exploitation of marine resources .
a full-scale humanitarian crisis is being faced by over four million people who are living in darfur at this time .
i would ask you to ensure in future - and this is not just your task as president but rather one for the commission as a whole , and for your staff - that documents are made available in good time and that the european parliament is treated seriously , so that we can work in a reasonable way , which is in both our interest and yours .
the call for russia to ratify the protocol is certainly an important step , but it falls within the scope of the political and economic relations which are being established with that country .
the commission is stepping up its effort to coordinate assistance for democratisation and civil society .
these are two areas which can increase its energy security and offer a high level of potential in terms of industrial development , innovation , spatial development and job creation .
this appears to me to be a major task for the belgian presidency .
do you ask them to smile in the face of death ?
i am not denying the risks in terms of blood supplies , but i think we can motivate potential donors by means other than money .
as you appreciate , gmos are in the top five of real concerns of european citizens , and public opinion in europe is very sceptical about gm products and is very worried about ‘frankenfoods’ .
so the commission ' s proposal is in line with neither the interests of community and acp producers , nor the long-term interests of european consumers , because it actually encourages the emergence of a far from competitive market situation .
the inevitable reform of the common agricultural policy highlights the importance of producing non-food crops .
i hope the ratification process carried out by the community , and by the member states that have yet to do so , is concluded at the earliest opportunity .
thank you , commissioner byrne .
five , strengthening social partnership with a more active involvement of civil society and local authorities . increasing the number of volunteers .
the reply to mr blokland 's question is in the negative ; no tyre manufacturers have contacted me , nor would i have advised any of them to do so , for they would have received the same reply that i am giving you now .
that too is a respectable organization .
mr president , at a time like this we europeans who are working together here must remind ourselves of the fundamental elements that unite us , and we must remember that we are working for a united , democratic europe which combats racism and xenophobia .
in this context , the report illuminates a number of important aspects .
anyone who saw it on television - and a great many people did see it , not only nationally but throughout europe - could see great despair in the eyes of those people , but also great dignity . that is perhaps what most struck the journalists , who have become used to grief and profound sorrow .
we have condemned these methods on various occasions and have called for their permanent eradication .
firstly , we have to look at the countries which make the biggest contribution .
however , it is very obvious that a general reduction of working hours without making the working time statutes more flexible leads to even higher labour costs and as a result jobs are lost .
this should also apply in future to this issue .
let us work together to achieve this .
we are able to support his report .
i am very grateful to the rapporteur for emphasising the problem of small and medium-sized enterprises , which i regard as the focal point of our efforts ; there are 25 million of them , and the european economy thrives on their flexibility and capacity for innovation .
therefore , certain changes have to be made to regulation 3448 in order to delete the provisions which no longer apply .
in fact , some ports or port installations , services and undertakings are , by their very nature , of general interest and should therefore be entitled to aid for specific development projects , contrary to the rapporteur 's proposals .
we are pledged to making a fresh start for europe .
in the process , it will destroy people 's lives .
with an internal market that is operating more and more efficiently , in which people increasingly go and work in other countries , and with an increasingly multicultural society that is extremely important .
we must ensure that all security and armed forces are clearly instructed that crimes and torture can not be tolerated , will be fully investigated , and the perpetrators held accountable .
i am pleased that the report fleshes out the commission 's recommendation , and for this i reiterate my congratulations to the rapporteur .
that means , i believe , that another solid success will be ours .
we need to prepare for the proper and effective application of this clause .
they are also concerned about equality of healthcare , which is considerable among the member states , as also within the countries themselves .
within this context , therefore , the accession of the european union – the community , strictly speaking – to the hague conference is a very important step and , i would insist , demonstrates the maturity of the european union ; it demonstrates that we still have a long way to go , including , amongst other things , in how these rules should be drawn up : third pillar , first pillar , etc . this is not the time to discuss it , but it is something that will improve the quality of our legislation and will undoubtedly enable the european union to bring its own priorities to the hague conference .
we have a text that has potential for the development of the industry - and therefore for keeping and creating jobs - and for users .
the ninth edf included funds left over from the previous edf : ‘unspent money’ .
second example : works councils .
no one would think , of course , of banning the use of digital cameras or of placing a social surcharge on the price of those cameras .
nor are ground troops , as we know .
he , too , should have perceived the very idea of laying railway tracks from one village to another for freight transport as being as slow as it is unrealistic .
in our opinion , this amounts to a body-blow for fiscal democracy , in that decisions taken at the level closest to the public are becoming increasingly subordinated to decisions taken at more remote levels .
we shall not be divided today , since we shall not forget that the target of this debate is a common enemy of spain and of europe : terrorism .
i declare adjourned the session of the european parliament .
as regards the carbon tax , we see it as almost inevitable that some member states will introduce this . so it must be sensibly prepared .
that material should let the public know that there is actually no risk from properly cooked poultry and that it is perfectly safe to buy it in supermarkets and to eat it in restaurants .
these two documents form the basis for the acidification strategy that we adopted three years ago .
as for the individual pillars of this strategy , my fellow-commissioners mr almunia and mr špidla will have something more to say about its macro-economic and employment aspects .
i also accept the duty of ecu 300 per tonne for this autonomous tariff quota , assuming that this will not give rise to new wto difficulties .
the eu has fully supported this demand .
it will take some time before vaccines are developed and available .
as the commissioner has stated , this is not a technical , minor issue .
are you optimistic or pessimistic about the integration of the iberian electricity market , which is , when all is said and done , our closest market ?
the european parliament must be a place of growth , of debate and of exchanges of best practice among the member states .
terrorism - wherever and by whoever it is committed - must be met with determined action and solidarity .
all interpretation based on economic criteria should be excluded .
today , there seems to be far less appetite for taking difficult political decisions .
on the contrary , i think it gives our citizens an excuse to portray the common agricultural policy in the most negative way , referring to the old-fashioned methods and tools that we used in previous times .
can you tell me that ?
but as you know , the us administration is not a problem here : we , and especially you , the members of parliament , must target your special efforts at the american senate , for it to support this treaty .
the vote will take place tomorrow , wednesday , at 12 noon .
it is irrational that this should be a matter of pride for the little nation , but it boosts our self-confidence , and that is of course always good .
there is some doubt about whether the facility will be able to reach and serve all its potential customers .
unfortunately , even the commission can not pride itself on a completely flawless financial record during the period in question .
equality needs to become a way of thinking .
i believe , ladies and gentlemen , that this should be the opportunity to fulfil our commitment to galicia .
in my view , they have acquitted themselves of their tasks as rapporteurs expertly , and they were , and still are , very approachable for all the groups .
it will be resumed this evening at 9.00 p.m .
mr president , as usual in debates on this subject , we have again heard many graphic descriptions today of the gruesome scenario that is unfolding in those countries , and if we thought at the time that rwanda was perhaps an isolated blot , as it were , on the history of our world in the 1990s , we are now faced with the cold truth that this sort of thing can be repeated in other places .
it also shows that the instruments best suited to providing the effective protection of fish species are those which are flexible and reversible , such as tacs and quotas , and not rigid structural measures with irreversible effects such as the destruction of vessels or the retraining of fishermen .
given the major consequences which this case might have , the commission will , however , continue to monitor the process and the dossier will not be closed before the commission has ascertained that the principles of transparency and equal treatment are upheld .
personally , i think it should be a matter for all to consider .
you pointed out the quality of the report and you even wrote , if i am not mistaken , that it marked a real improvement in comparison with previous reports .
it is hurtful to be accused of being anti-american simply because one is opposed to the policy of the current us administration .
no such action plan has been adopted with regard to belarus , as the eu has no contractual relations with that country .
( de ) madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we have now heard everything from the experts who produced the report - mr rasmussen , mr lehne , mr lauk , thank you very much .
and yet , i must remind you that nothing can be taken for granted .
we recognise that morocco has some concerns , which we hope can be satisfied , so that we can move on to that sort of formal agreement as soon as reasonable .
indeed , we are well aware that we need to adapt our rules to the specific circumstances of small and medium-sized enterprises , and that is why we very strongly support the plan for small and medium-sized enterprises that has been proposed by the commission and endorsed by the council .
i think that is the most topical of the questions concerning children ' s rights .
enabling european citizens to submit proposals for new legislation on a matter of social importance is an invaluable part of democracy , and i feel honoured that i can be part of the process of giving this tool to the residents of europe .
is that the solution that we need to turn back to ?
apart from that , the knock-on effect into the neighbouring countries , especially rwanda and burundi , could destabilise still further the fragile rebuilding of ethnic cohabitation in those countries .
i should like to thank mr sjöstedt for the courage with which he has negotiated this narrow path .
we want to make it easier for young people and the most vulnerable to access culture and creative content , and we want to encourage mobility and promote cultural diversity as well as the use and spread of free software and open standards .
will we not get into a terrible mess if we constantly change the title so late in the day , having established the legal base ?
i do not want to exclude our needing to review how the exceptions are to be worded once we have obtained more information and know exactly what types of plant are concerned .
every referendum tells a story .
however , their duration varies and the agreement with lithuania is supplemented by a protocol on temporary joint ventures and joint enterprises , under which the contracting parties undertake to promote the establishment of joint enterprises , which would then receive financial support from the community .
in writing . - the tragic situation in burma demands urgent attention .
so the european perspective has to be credible and has to be underlined and demonstrated by concrete measures .
these regions face natural difficulties , which makes production more difficult and restricts access .
i naturally signed an authorisation pass and she was able to make contact with our librarians who did everything to help her with her research on europe .
on the first part of mrs maij-weggen 's question , about a proposal being rejected by qualified majority , that can not happen when the initiative comes from the member states .
in addition , the absence of the right of entry implies a need to maintain controls at internal borders , in order to check whether entry onto that territory can be authorized .
the commission should also move more quickly in drawing up guidelines for importing tropical hardwood into the union .
and what of democracy ?
but racism can not be tolerated no matter where it raises its ugly head , and i believe we all have to stand up and say that this is completely unacceptable and that it can not happen no matter where it takes place .
the united states can have some of our passenger data , but on three conditions .
when the talks between the spö and övp broke down , the socialists attempted to form a minority government and asked the fpö for their support .
of course , i thank the commissioner for his very full answer , from which we can nevertheless extract some new elements in this thriller , if i may call it that .
calls for a ban on such imports must be viewed in this light , yet such calls continue to be made .
the current directive introduces a direct right of action for the victim , which applies not only to the person responsible but also to the insurance undertaking .
this is a very big problem on the river torne .
we will push for intensive support for smes in future too .
on behalf of the europe for the nations group , i warmly welcome bulgaria and romania to the union .
eventually , only the top 10 % to 20 % of products per category can be awarded the ecolabel .
as i conclude , i should like to call on the house to support the introduction of reproductive health rights into this report . i am addressing the more conservative members in particular .
whilst i am aware that many of the members present will probably back the directive , it is not the first time that this house has appeared totally incapable of representing the european public .
i would like to point out that i was a member of the afet delegation which prepared the priorities for the spanish presidency in madrid , in october 2009 .
our neighbours , especially in the mediterranean , also have enormous expectations regarding these networks and their own networks , and we are looking forward to receiving the communication that the commission has promised us on the methodology , which will complement the consultation and the debates , before starting work on one of the most exciting exercises for our committee on transport and tourism .
a state such as france has already in fact implemented the terms of the marpol convention by guaranteeing that each port has top quality waste disposal and processing facilities , operated by private companies , which invoice the shipowner directly according to the type and nature of the waste . reducing the costs for use by vessels deemed to be 'ecological ' is therefore only natural .
a right to copy on-air broadcasts for storage on electronic systems is required because , otherwise , the giant recording companies will be able to control the radio and television companies ' music output .
i have to say with some emphasis , that , in past negotiations , we expected a great deal of the candidate countries , and the european union 's positions were not always founded on in-depth understanding of the candidates ' problems ; rather , they were very often motivated by our own needs .
for us this is a community programme that brings the eu closer to its citizens and the citizens closer to one another , which is the reason why we love this programme .
however , mrs harms , this means that we need to try to find a proper balance in each subject area , for on the issue of climate change , for example , the action we take must not produce any undesired effects which could have social consequences .
. mr president , today is a day of remembrance .
the eu population is growing old and in order to ensure the sustainability of the social welfare schemes increasing work productivity is necessary .
the implementation of the rule of law requires that the powers of government , judicial , legislative and executive , be separate from and independent of each other so that each is a check on the others , thereby ensuring that none can abuse its power .
mrs gebhardt , could you once again explain your proposal .
it would be naive of anyone to believe that they could still persuade others during this kind of debate .
let me give you an example : it was rather ridiculous that the german federal land of bavaria , following the fall of the iron curtain , did not want to recognize the ddr abitur .
let us help our neighbours achieve their democratic aspirations , so that they will want to live in their own countries and be able at last to do so with dignity , and not be forced to emigrate .
the commission 's preliminary draft budget was eur 129.2 billion for commitment appropriations and eur 121 billion for payment appropriations .
madam president , madam commissioner , parliament has designated this women 's day , on which particular attention is drawn to the situation of afghan women .
i welcome the good intentions expressed here , by both the council and the commission , but i should like to see those words translated into action and should like to hear what practical measures the commission and the council are going to take to remedy this state of affairs , and i am not talking here about the situation of women in poor countries , of muslim women , of women in a poor country in africa or asia at the mercy of a corrupt despot or of fanatical terrorists , where people do not live but die slowly , as we have seen – and already mentioned in this debate – with the situation of women in turkey , with whom i should like to express my solidarity .
the people there are governing themselves and they have played into the hands of a few large interested parties , but they have not made any progress .
this is , therefore , a profound change ...
we already know about the suppression of the ancient buddhist tibetan culture over the last 60 years ; now we see the same threat looming over the city of kashgar in the restive province of xinjiang .
( parliament agreed to the request )
the prodi package is simply a good starting point and we all need to agree that a bigger europe with less money is out of the question .
if we really want to help the affected countries , we must support only financial projects that have a high degree of innovation and which consistently conserve the environment .
in doing so , they have achieved considerable progress .
although those are key points , crucial points , we believe that it is right that the igc ranges beyond just those three issues .
one particular concern centred on the possible statistical implications of pension reforms .
to set themselves intermediate goals which were achievable in single steps , that was a sign of the courage and foresight of this generation .
you have not given in to the easiest options or to demagogy , and the results are there to see .
the economic , social and environmental importance of forests at an international , european , regional and national level is generally well known and legitimised , to some extent , in international agreements and relevant cooperation and financing programmes .
the european union has a key role and must lead ambitions on climate change .
the convention on the rights of the child recognises the responsibilities of parents in providing the proper care and attention to their children , as well as the child 's right to receive this care , guidance , and love .
to be honest , and this is my final comment , emsa carries out important work which we must recognise and take into account when we discuss the european union 's maritime strategy .
mr president , first of all i should like to associate myself with what mr tomlinson has just said .
unfortunately , the point was raised that rich blind people will benefit .
i hope , commissioner , to have an answer sooner or later , before the day is out .
mr president , this is just to be helpful .
moreover , we take the view that there is no need for a strengthening of the defence policy dimension of the eu . on the contrary , we believe that the eu member states should continue to coordinate their defence cooperation through nato .
( sv ) the june list believes that the whole idea of a european year of this or that is unnecessary and not something that eu taxpayers should fund .
it is unbelievable that so much money has come back from the structural funds from the previous year 's budget and that nothing is being done in order to ensure that we shall manage to sort this out for the following year at least .
as the representative of the people of the european union , our parliament must take a very careful look at the contents of this document .
in that context if it is complex then we need a series of ideas and initiatives and solutions to ensure that we can try and take away the terrible feeling of insecurity that now exists within the european union .
what we need instead , my dear mr cohn-bendit , in the face of such a web of international terrorism , is clear answers , for this terrorism menaces the whole of the free world , it menaces us and it menaces the united states too .
this will soon become reality if we accept the suggestion that the 180 car and motorcycle manufacturers concerned will end up charging more for repairs and , consequently , for insurance .
then a situation can arise in which we do have codecision over agricultural expenditure but in which we are obliged to simply hand out money to farmers because they have a right to it under european law .
but not all delays are due to air traffic controls .
i believe that the text , in the terms in which it provides for inclusion , is intended to achieve both the elimination of unfair competition and the granting of a prudent time limit for the self-employed to adapt to the new situation and to ensure their protection .
associated with this is the need for close synchronisation with the water framework directive , so that everything in the daughter directive lies within the scope of its parent directive .
it is only with high-quality legislation that the law can be understood and applied correctly .
that is just one example of where we have tried to go along with parliament 's wishes .
some of our companies have responded by developing new types of technical textiles , for example a hinckley company developed special flight socks , and a derby company developed special heat-resistant clothing for use by firefighters .
in writing . - ( fr ) this third energy package dogmatically persists in following the course of total separation between the energy production side and the distribution networks .
i believe the likely outcome to be that , instead of europe being strengthened , it will become increasingly divided .
according to reports commissioned by a large number of governments , including the dutch government , a 20 % reduction in emissions is a long way from the world 's most ambitious target .
a quick and radical change of course is required here .
this means , first of all , that the member states will need to earmark part of their budget for this sector and i agree with the report , which encourages the use of the structural funds for investment in the health sector ; it is a very good proposal and i urge all the member states , especially the new member states , to make use of this facility .
mr president , mr president-in-office of the council , i would like to start by pointing out once again that nearly the entire ppe group was present at the time when the president-in-office of the council spoke and that he received our full applause , as also the applause of the german christian democrats , because we too will support him in what he said - provided he also acts on it .
the first is respect for viewers , regardless of age , origins or situation .
the european institutions , parliament , the commission and the council , have sufficient experience in staff recruitment .
the text of the letter sent by the belarus government contains two undertakings : one , to discuss with all the deputies in the 13th supreme council the constitutional changes necessary to establish a greater separation of powers .
in the context of this agreement , we are complying with the demands of these amendments , which are therefore not necessary .
the distance between the citizens and the european elite is growing in such a way that the entire european project is put at risk , whereas instead everyone should be working towards true democracy .
firstly , i would like to point out that the first discrepancy between the commission and the fishing sector usually relates to the duration of plans .
this remains an unresolved issue at the present juncture .
it is essential if we want to exit the crisis successfully , restore growth , translate that growth into more and better jobs , and ultimately ensure a sustainable and inclusive future for europe .
in the days to come , we will be negotiating on the framework agreement .
since mr goebbels has already mentioned many of these things , i really would like to see all these things spelled out at the summit .
it appears to me that as weeks go by , this assessment seems to be ever more correct , and i am delighted .
human rights
so i think that from platforms , from initiatives , from networks , to get into an integrated partnership is a reasonable change of the way we innovate .
we have even managed to bring in the more ambitious requirement that the quality of groundwater should not deteriorate , and so , rather than fighting a running battle , we really are clamping down on pollution .
madam president , it is vital to focus and coordinate the aid for the applicant countries effectively by means of the three instruments available if we are to achieve maximum possible benefit .
we also demand a firmer stance in bilateral relations , so as to stop or limit the devaluation of the yuan , the ridiculous bank rates and the massive investment in new machinery that are helping the chinese market to such a great extent .
on behalf of the gue/ngl group . - ( cs ) ladies and gentlemen , when the library in alexandria burned down during caesar 's invasion of egypt , a substantial part of all the literature written by mankind at that stage disappeared forever .
that is one of the reasons why my vote in favour is intended as a gesture of assent for a joint resolution to provide support for belarus to participate in the process of cooperating with the european union .
thus , there is every reason to provide the necessary support .
the first concerns how the charter will be incorporated into your ideas for a small business act , which i consider to be a very important and exciting new development .
the victims of human trafficking are mostly women and children , and the punishment which threatens the criminals is not sufficiently severe to deter them from this kind of activity .
ruminants , such as sheep , dairy cows and suckler cows , are for the most part fed on the products of the farm itself .
virtually all documents will be placed on a public register .
however , we must not become hysterical or incite unwarranted panic .
in writing . - i voted against the gauzès report on the aifm directive because it disadvantages an important part of the united kingdom 's most important industry - financial services .
( de ) mr president , the aim of reducing the administrative burden for micro-entities should , of course , receive our full support , as should the aim of preventing micro-enterprises from being thrown into the same pot as the big players when it comes to financial reporting .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , at the heart of the new growth and employment policy with which we seek to move the lisbon agenda forward , are the integrated economic guidelines ; they are integrated because they reflect the recognition that we can not satisfactorily perform the task of bringing europe more growth and more jobs if we fail to make the close connection between macro-economic , micro-economic and employment goals .
the document gives a guarantee of a high level of consumer protection in all the member states and will help clarify areas of confusion in retail trade conducted between businesses and consumers from different countries .
you referred to rule 29 ( 2 ) but that rule simply says that 'the minimum number of members required to form a political group shall be 29 if they come from one member state ... ' - if they come from ! mr president , could you confirm that means elected from , otherwise mr goldsmith could attempt to use his british citizenship and thereby establish another nation .
i would just like to say that we are not trying to turn europe into a fortress with sis iii ; we are simply trying to make sure that the removal of internal borders does not mean a greater risk of uncertainty , violence and terrorism for the european union and for european citizens .
1. the extra costs incurred for extra rights will translate into permanently higher ticket costs across the board for all passengers ;
the second concerns the discrepancies between europe’s ambitions and the resources needed to implement the most important part of the space programme , and this seems to be the issue that the white paper has left open .
the third freedom , of the provision of services , is also at risk .
i want to say to mr jarzembowski that this law would be devastating for jobs .
the appropriate insurance should be taken out to cover any potential risk or damage caused by the project , either in its construction or thereafter .
the measure is actually intended to help beekeepers to cope with the increased production costs that result from dealing with varroasis .
this is going to be a difficult decision for members tomorrow .
i believe we must call a halt to projects of that kind which are directly harmful to biodiversity .
( es ) madam president , before we begin the vote on this report i must say that along with the rapporteur , mrs panayotopoulos , and the other rapporteurs , i have an oral amendment to propose regarding the first amendment to paragraph 6 .
directive 2004/22 was an important step in this movement .
are there any comments ?
i do not want to start an argument at this point over whether the commission is a kind of government .
as a socialist , i therefore support the substance of the proposals included in our joint resolution .
if it is a legislative issue , parliament should participate through codecision and would consequently have full rights to act jointly with the states involved in enhanced cooperation , with equal legal status .
there is no question of choosing between strasbourg and brussels in this instance , since according to the treaties that founded our union in the beginning , strasbourg is the rule and brussels the exception .
how do you expect the commission to sympathise with that , as if it were not a question of economic interest .
indeed there is a question about the project data and it infrastructure for a modern land registry that is co-financed by the european regional development fund .
so , in general , we use our regular dialogues to refer to this issue .
looking back at the road we have left behind and at the blossoming of european democracy over the last 50 years should make us proud and very grateful to the fathers of the european concept .
in this particular instance , the first proposal dates back to 1993 .
this is a matter that goes far beyond political partisanship , and concerns , or should concern , all members of this house , for it concerns the dignity and functioning of our institution .
large projects are bound to have a greater impact , but given the size of most businesses , it is questionable whether such projects will get off the ground in large numbers .
that traffic is good business .
the question still is whether this strategy 's objectives should feature as part of implementing cohesion , using the danube 's economic and transport potential , and protecting the river , its ecosystem and water quality .
the united nations development programme ( undp ) report of 2006 shows there has been flagrant injustice .
firstly , the burden of combating climate change has been distributed very unfairly within the european union .
as a negotiating tactic , i would strengthen the argument in defence of the community system , to guarantee stability mechanisms on the world market , knowing that stability of world prices is beneficial to all members of the world trade organisation .
i myself am a woman of exile , because , as you are well aware , the real women in white are not with us today , unfortunately .
there was general support for exploring certain issues at eu level , for example the issue of ‘one share , one vote’ , at least by carrying out a fact-finding study , or the rights of shareholders .
there are the tasks of completely abolishing the death penalty and of getting the political process under way that is necessary if political life in the turkish state is to be democratised .
what surprises me is that the international community and the united nations never manages to learn , to anticipate from the experiences of somalia , rwanda , bosnia , kosovo , and now east timor .
there is – as is well known – increasing settlement and industrialisation in exposed areas , for example on the coastline and in the flatlands of rivers , and so natural disasters , under such circumstances , can be prevented only with great difficulty if at all , but we can make the effort – by means of a solidarity fund such as this one – to alleviate the consequences in so far as possible .
we know that .
if we view the railway sector in the context of the agreements in the lisbon declaration which call upon us to become the most competitive region in the world by 2010 , we have to achieve this , otherwise our hearts will be in our boots .
distinctive cultures are made by distinctive peoples and not the other way round .
providing it to regions at risk can be achieved at modest expense and perhaps save hundreds of thousands of lives .
it is therefore laudable that the commission has presented this package and that the council has also decided at long last that something must be done .
if not , then the dissidents can expect , at least , to be banned from any participation in the work of the european union .
( de ) mr president , although mrs oomen-ruijten 's report contains many criticisms of turkey , i voted against it because , in my view , full membership for turkey can not be the aim of the accession negotiations .
the vienna-based european monitoring centre pays particular attention to this issue when carrying out research into manifestations of racism and xenophobia in the european union .
i believe that this debate is proof of parliament’s interest in this key issue .
brussels will not be able to go on administering them in the long run .
we also believe that environmental problems are cross-border in character and that there is thus added value in dealing with these issues at eu level .
this new sort of literacy has to be taught to many adults starting at the beginning .
let me conclude by saying that over and above the european research area , which i believe will be a structural component of the next framework programme , we will also have to create links between the research areas and the whole field of university education .
this budget does not represent a convincing signal to the people of the european union , but the management of the status quo at less than the lowest common denominator .
so far , however , there has been no more than grandiloquent announcements and reams of paper .
the council has also noted the intention to hold presidential and parliamentary elections in january next year .
we should vote in favour of this important step , not only for their sake , but also for the sake of the whole of the european union .
mr van den broek was very clear about this .
we have an old saying in scotland that you can not polish a turnip and no amount of presentation will disguise the fact that the eu has a structural problem which we are not addressing .
uclaf is still young - not yet ten years old - and of course it has experienced growing pains .
on behalf of the gue/ngl group . - ( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i believe that it is right to extend the powers and activities of the european monitoring centre on racism and xenophobia .
why do you reject , as you have pointed out , the amendment introduced by us to article 53 ( 1 ) of the classic directive , in which we allude to environmental characteristics , but also to modes of production ?
can it also reassure us that competition policy will not continue to undermine the legitimate efforts of regional and cohesion policies ?
mr president , mr president-in-office of the council , mr president of the commission , ladies and gentlemen , things being as they are , i have only two minutes’ speaking time , and so i shall confine myself to the stability and growth pact and say that the existence of a political agreement within the council to revamp certain aspects of this pact is good news .
the time has come for us to end export refunds .
money , especially monetary policy , is not at all a neutral subject .
this makes it even more difficult to investigate the crime and hence to apply the law .
in this respect , i would like to draw attention to two specific points , which i think are extremely indicative of the spirit and the methods which predominate within the union ' s institutions .
i have to say , commissioner , i was rather disappointed by your response to them .
i should like to finish off by saying a few words about the possibility of potential misuse and fraud , which is a real problem . it is hoped that readjustments can be made by simplifying the criteria of origin and simplifying administrative procedures , as well as by making the conditions for regional cumulation more flexible .
we simply have to look at the text and compare it with the council ' s mandate to see how arbitrary the commission has been .
it is precisely as one honourable member said just now . liberia is not a kuwait .
the commission must take the driving seat and lead this process .
there have been others during this parliamentary term .
there is no other product which is manufactured from chlorine and which produces such large quantities of additives with highly dubious environmental and health-related effects .
we never want to forget that the peoples of the baltic countries never , ever , chose to join the soviet union .
the message is that their fundamental rights matter to us , their freedom matters to us , their security matters to us , it matters to us to work together to fight trans-national organised crime , violence and terrorism , and to protect all victims of these types of crime , especially the victims of terrorism .
on the other hand , this flexible approach to granting eu funds will be monitored closely to prevent the occurrence of abuses .
they point first and foremost to the social , cultural and democratic significance , and to the new opportunities offered by the digital dividend we ought to be offering european citizens .
discussion of the financial problems connected with enlargement no longer focuses , essentially , on the financial issues of 2004 , 2005 and 2006 ; we are indeed already doing the groundwork for discussion of the next financial perspective for the post-2006 period .
that is why , whenever i can , i urge the commission and the council to provide financial support to improve district-heating systems in order to make it socially acceptable and environmentally efficient .
this is not the result of liberalisation , which came along much later .
they have invested heavily in order to comply with standards and are subject to no fewer than 70 regulations , directives and other european decisions .
remarkably , just a few days ago we had news that quite a large number of people in this situation who had been abducted were indeed released .
i acknowledge that , although we have made a good start , we are entitled to have conflicting feelings about the union ' s decision-making power in this field .
we do not want to undermine what is a very important sector in our economies - the financial sector - but we believe that some more measures are important to restore confidence in the financial sector .
but we are surrounded by nuclear power stations using obsolete russian technology .
we have said for a long time that the edf does not give the correct democratic accountability and that it is compromised by its legal and financial framework .
such a decision is supportive of debate in the member countries , with a view to enabling rapid ratification of the treaty .
mrs oomen-ruijten , i have taken note of your criticism .
perhaps we are forgetting our cultural and architectural heritage , which is of great value , and also that , to have people at the top of their professions , we need to give them adequate training , and that is why , in our opinion , a study course can not stop after a few years .
that has an effect on almost all feed proteins and on additives .
mr president , parliament has been a consistent supporter of enlargement and , in particular , the timely accession of bulgaria and romania .
more than half of parliament 's amendments have been accepted .
in cases of divorce , the jugendamt uses any method to deprive the parent who is not german of their parental rights .
however , the effectiveness and quality of our aid have not , to date , been commensurate with its volume .
( for the results and other details on the vote : see minutes )
cyprus and malta are still today among the top five flags of convenience in terms of the number of vessels lost .
amendments nos 7 and 17 reformulating the text of the common position on maternity and paternity leave by reintroducing inter alia the idea of maternity and paternity leave where children are adopted .
and before dealing with the issue of transatlantic flights , i too would like to express my condolences in relation to the terrible accident involving the flash airlines aircraft on 3 january in which 148 people died , the majority of whom were european citizens .
we do not know of any objections raised by any of the member states regarding the procedures envisaged for the entry of any individual country into the schengen area .
it follows that the basic criteria – 3 % for the deficit , 60 % for the debt – will remain applicable .
we can not call on the european union to do more , and then persist with a narrow , blinkered approach .
trade protection instruments must be effective and must guarantee that all our businesses have fair conditions of competition .
now , in the council , where is our 'put a man on the moon ' project in europe ?
the revised proposal takes into account the outcome of a consultation process that started in 2004 with the council 's working party on nuclear safety .
of the 15 old eu member states , greece , spain , portugal and ireland have received support every single year since they became members .
so quality marks may be useful but they have their limitations .
you have the monetary report . you know what is needed - to encourage investment , attract capital and boldly cut bureaucratic expenses .
what freedom is there when the citizens are not consulted on their new constitution under the lisbon treaty because they would reject it ? what liberty is there in laws made by undemocratic institutions that can not be removed by the voter ?
would you please carry that concern back to the presidency of parliament .
we still think that , despite the distress we are witnessing in the occupied palestinian territory and in lebanon , we should profit from an important window of opportunity in the peace process in case it shuts down again , so it is very important that the german initiative is successful .
i should like to thank commissioner papoutsis and his staff very warmly indeed .
unfortunately , this has not yet happened .
these additional restrictions and bureaucratic requirements will only discourage investment in life science research in europe , and further encourage the investment in research to transfer to other areas with more favourable legislation outside europe .
( pl ) mr president , i had the pleasure of being an observer during the presidential elections in ukraine , at both the first and second rounds , as , indeed , i had several years ago .
it would therefore be wrong to suggest , as some have done , that it should fund itself .
as far as television is concerned , according to our polls 64 % of european citizens recognise that whatever they know about the european union comes from television .
it is up to the council and the member states to show that they are serious and committed , and pave the way so that the financial situation can be set right .
we must point out , however , that even if the actual appropriations available for leader + were increased , the community initiative would still be ineffectual because such programmes can not compensate for or blunt the anti-farming nature of the cap that will be implemented in the context of 'agenda 2000 ' and the wto . the real outcome of such programmes is to act as a cover-up , to lead people off the scent and to salve consciences .
we ensure that policies have been well managed .
i believe that this is a serious , far-reaching and fair offer .
if i have understood you correctly , mr president , i believe that your reading does not entirely correspond to the true division of the text , but perhaps that is a communication problem .
mr president , far and away most of the eu 's businesses have committed themselves to social responsibility , to socially and environmentally responsible action , to the protection of people and their environment , and to security of production .
that directive was adopted in 1982 following a series of accidents involving dangerous substances and was amended following two major accidents , namely the one at bhopal and the one at basle which polluted the rhine .
we all know that parties and their organisations are dependent on financial contributions .
to use the words of barack obama : 'we can do it , yes we can ' .
i believe we have handed on many solutions and many means of solution to ireland , and not because we were resigned to doing so . having the means of solution is the result of setting out the problems for the future .
unfortunately , this agreement does not fully follow the aarhus convention as it does not allow the public to be fully involved in the development of policy which frames planning decisions .
we will help and we want this country to succeed as the triumph of the survivors over those who had other designs .
amendment no 21 would require a direct comparison between the performance of member states in improving air quality and the commission could not accept this amendment as the proposed comparison is not considered appropriate , in particular , with regard to the transboundary nature of ozone .
the permitted number of pupils in classes in european schools is 32 .
the members of the court of auditors must monitor careful spending of european funds and be ruthless in pointing out irregularities .
( applause )
it enabled me , as chairman of the intergovernmental conference , to make an oral report on progress at the conference .
once greater transparency and clarity has been secured , the price will fall too .
first of all , that of evaluation as an instrument to improve quality - the aim of which is not to establish who is top and who is bottom of the class , but rather simply to act as an incentive so that everyone ends up at the top of the class .
that , in brief , is my answer , madam president , but we will have occasion to return to this major issue .
although i do not expect anybody else to support that , i hope those who disagree will understand that in a democratic society when you make a commitment to people who elect you , you try and comply with that commitment when you get elected .
detailed consideration should be given to facilitating the integration of smes in areas which are difficult to access , such as run-down districts , difficult rural areas and peripheral regions .
as regards decision-making in the council , i am of course totally in favour of the extension of qualified majority voting . most speakers referred to this issue , although some were naturally opposed to it .
the report is , therefore , unfortunately basically flawed .
i agree with what mr goodwill said about chainsaws and the difficulty of reaching those standards insofar as that piece of equipment is concerned . but i also want to resist , as mr lange said , the commission 's proposals for averaging and banking .
therefore , i believe that some of the other measures proposed deserve to be looked into further .
mrs berger , i have never denied the fact that the concentration camps existed , and certainly not the mauthausen camp .
however , it is also important - and this is my second point - to clearly understand that , in the near future , it will not be possible to resort to it at every turn .
the fear of terror attacks that has grown since last year has prompted a revival of plans to reinforce the army , police and secret services and to restrict civil liberties .
i hope that the next presidency will be able to inform you that we have complete agreement on the four common spaces that form the basis of this relationship .
a detailed check must be carried out on this information , along with an objective evaluation of the possible repercussions which allowing inmates to return to their country of residence could have .
that is my personal opinion , as the committee has not yet been able to reach a decision .
i wonder what muslims in britain and across europe think when the british conservatives say that troops from muslim countries can not be relied upon to do their job in a united nations force ?
these directives do not address properly the very real risk of contamination of non-gm and organic agriculture with gm varieties .
it is in the same spirit that i will present to the european council some of the major challenges for the g20 that will take place in june in canada .
regrettably , there have been fatal casualties on both sides , and more than 3 000 people living close to the conflict area have had to be evacuated .
in the dire situation of north korea , we are being given an opportunity to make amends for the terrible wrong done to poland’s prisoners .
according to this principle , it must be possible for a judge to verify the legality of legislation of any kind .
however hard we try to keep our water – and our groundwater in particular – clean , and to restore its purity where it is already polluted , we must , not least at european level , strike a sensible balance between the requirements of the water industry , the needs of agriculture , the eco-systems and the resources available for maintaining and restoring the purity of water in the member states .
thirdly , i would like to have something clarified .
it says : 'looks forward to the report of the president of the commission preparing for the cologne summit of the internal reform of the commission .
so let us take all the measures needed to protect the euro area and the euro .
this is not about carrying out general human rights investigations and setting ourselves up in competition with other institutions , in particular the council of europe .
it was a movement inspired by values .
there are at present 25 different systems of vehicle taxation in the eu , and putting them on a uniform footing will help the internal market work better ; that much we know , and to those members who would deny it , one has to say that it simply has to be admitted that the effect of this proposal is to do away with the distortions and inefficiency that result from double taxation when vehicles are transported across borders .
first of all , the proposal conflicts with legislation and practices in my own country , the netherlands .
overall , though , contrary to expectation , the consequences and results of those conferences have been far more good than bad .
his was no easy task , and it is surely no secret that there have been debates within the group of the european people’s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats , although we have been able to satisfactorily resolve these issues .
from a geographical perspective , it is sub-saharan africa , as we just recalled as a matter of fact , which continues to experience the most catastrophic situation and , with things going as they are , the risk is that this will continue for many more years .
it is true that the rapporteur has done a magnificent job but i believe that we should not tackle the group of final amendments on the content of the net here , in this directive , because in short what those amendments do is allow intermediate service providers to filter and block content on the net and therefore , ultimately , consumers will lose their anonymity .
in those countries where little venture capital activity exists it is difficult , if not impossible , to meet the second condition .
the eu would nonetheless be seriously threatened as a peace project if , in the future , the council were to give turkey a date for entering into membership negotiations while that country continues with the military occupation , begun in 1974 , of 37 % of the territory of the republic of cyprus , that is to say of a future member state .
the objective and what is at stake is important as the euro must be given a voice so the community can be present in the international monetary arena to defend its interests , to participate in managing and preventing crises and , on a more general level , to adapt the international monetary system .
if that turns out to be the case , would sweden be obliged to be in erm ii for two years before being allowed to become an actual member ?
i think we should give a little more protection to people who act responsibly than to those who act irresponsibly .
both parties have repeated their commitment to finding a solution .
i ask commissioner patten in closing the debate , first to assure us that the facility will be utilised in response to crises world-wide in support of the eu 's development goals and not just in europe 's own backyard .
it ignores flexibility and iter .
i am going to tell you how the spanish presidency should not be measured .
diagnosis means lives saved .
we have voted today against the recommendation for second reading concerning a community action programme in the field of cultural heritage , the raphael programme , just as we voted against the programme at first reading .
that is why it is so incredibly tragic to see it heading straight for the abyss .
this is one of the key political elements in this report .
in poland , no sensible person is questioning the fact that there were mistakes made by us during the whole process of preparing and carrying out the late president 's visit .
this report seeks to involve small and medium-sized enterprises and society 's various players in the standardisation process .
already there are member states within the european union who have a conscience about this issue , who have serious reservations .
it is so embarrassing .
i support this motion for a resolution because , among the concerns that it raises about this country are concerns that i share .
that would be too simple , however , for the generations of self-styled 'fathers of europe ' .
therefore , since i am appearing here in the european parliament as a representative of the council of the union , and not of the spanish government , i can not answer your question .
there are reactions to this in some quarters since it does not comply with the liberal canons of beauty which stipulate that there must be no financial intervention in order support an administration .
at the same time , however , it approves of the restructuring of government spending in favour of investment which must be justified - when it is justified - by the cost-benefit ratio , but rejects using public investments simply to manage the economy .
there is little doubt that the ombudsman is one of the most important aids to securing the citizen’s position in his dealings with the institutions .
thank you , sir leon .
to this end the results will have to be assessed in practical terms and our great ambitions must not be abandoned .
the debate is closed .
these are not easy tasks by any means .
in this case , i think that they are the aspects relating to safety : specifically safety in terms of the environmental impact , which we could say started the whole movement , but also safety , at present , in relation to the responsibilities of the different actors involved , identifying and clarifying which they are and how we should act in response to them , establishing landmarks for the future fight against piracy , and , even more importantly , making progress with improving the working , social and professional conditions of those who work at sea .
it is not enough , however .
mr president , i wish to warmly welcome the report by my esteemed colleague , mr bowis , on patients ' rights to cross-border health care .
ultimately , frontex can only be as good as member states permit .
canada , which was facing economic recession some years ago , has consciously invested in science and technology and is now reaping the economic rewards of its efforts .
madam president , the commission agrees with the presidency that the national and provincial assembly elections held in pakistan on 10 october should be seen as a first step in the gradual transition from a military to a civilian administration with permanent and well-functioning democratic institutions .
madam president , the murder of bishop juan josé gerardi is seen by many as an attack on the peace process .
it is american pork-barrel politics - special pleading for sectoral interests - brought into the european parliament .
energy security must be one of the criteria taken into account when european investment bank lending mandates are being granted to developing world countries .
i believe there must be a wide-ranging international coalition supported by the united nations resolution .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
part one
slovakia 's adoption of the euro is a great example to other states and an incentive to them to increase their efforts and adopt additional measures for achieving the convergence criteria .
therefore , if he is telling me that the door will be open as soon as there is an agreement and he knows , as i do , that there already is an agreement , surely we can take it as read that libya will finally participate in the coming euro-mediterranean conference in stuttgart as a full member . this was requested by the euro-mediterranean forum held in the european parliament in november and i believe that it is a wise move .
mr president , whilst this is wonderful for guantánamo bay , which is a symbol , we should not forget that there are also other prisons we should voice an opinion about .
another problem is the negative impact that eu market rules are having on regional and local authorities ' right to maintain and initiate services of general interest , including social services .
a mass , dynamic , grass-roots movement needs to develop against these policies to grab public assets and impose a mediaeval working regime and slave wages .
it also represents a first step by syria towards the implementation of un security council resolution 1559 .
what measures does it intend to take to ensure that this act is not applied to european undertakings ?
it seems that the main reason why the irish , the citizens of the green isle , supported the treaty , is because of what they secured from the european union in the meantime .
again , i think it is regrettable that no one from the council is present at this important debate .
we are talking about the collateral damage resulting from pre-emptive war , such as the humiliation of prisoners of war in guantánamo , where the geneva convention is not respected , where people are denied the right to a public and fair trial , to legal representation , and people are tortured .
during recent negotiations on the economic partnership agreements , many members right across the political spectrum were concerned about the commission 's one-size-fits-all approach to the epas .
these are to be found within the armed forces , although capability may certainly vary from one country to another . in the main , however , they can supply qualified personnel , technologies , advanced technological resources , organisational capacity and military methods of research and development .
it is vital that they can use national parliamentary controls to handle incomings which , particularly in a budget-support policy , can often be an important lever in their national policies .
if our wish list is considered to be an over-decorated christmas tree , then one could well say that the result from johannesburg is more like a christmas tree with no needles - but nevertheless a christmas tree .
in that respect too , therefore , this directive has been given the green light .
the president of the european parliament , mr pöttering , was in the chair when mr schulz spoke , and so this is a question for mr pöttering .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m .
2 ) an immediate freeze , until an independent analysis has established the added value of this decentralisation once and for all .
there is potential for substantial support from the structural funds under both the competitiveness and the convergence objectives .
that is the only way to make sure it never happens again .
it is , of course , essential for the supervisory system to allow sanctions to be imposed .
thus , we expect israel , in particular , to give priority to political dialogue rather than further militarisation .
over the past year , the petitions committee and the ombudsman worked very well together ; i believe that the way in which they managed this should be a model not only for the cooperation between the ombudsman and the commission but also – and this is a point to which i shall return later – for the cooperation between the ombudsman and the council .
( parliament adopted the resolution . )
you said you would not allow anybody other than the person who put down the question to ask questions and then you allow a gentleman here to get in on the back of my question .
it is not coincidental that at the height of the crisis the bulgarian parliament asked its european partners to revive the debate on reactivating the closed reactors at kozloduy , which have been proved safe by the competent authorities .
its provisions are not precise , and not only are they causing controversy , but they are already causing a division among the eu 's leaders .
nothing is taken for granted .
shipping , with its secondary registers and the use of flags of convenience , has indeed become a test case , and i shall be full of admiration for mr flynn if he succeeds in achieving stability in this area .
it is simplistic to talk of containing spending and only to present budgetary considerations for reforming the aid system , when what is really happening is that farmers ' incomes are falling whilst we are witnessing an increase in imports from outside the european union .
finally , i would emphasize two more ideas : the problems of vulnerable communities from any point of view , either ethnic and/or geographical , could be treated more efficiently if there were cooperation in this field between the local , regional , national and european authorities .
it is necessary for projects from ngos and small communities to continue to be given a priority so that europe 's pressure can contribute to safeguarding the environment , sustainable growth in this world which has been hit so hard in recent years by one form of destruction after another .
one such candidate is ljubljana , the capital of slovenia . this candidate 's proposal has substantial support and , in the hope that it will be successful , it has been carefully and thoroughly prepared .
what we are doing in the report is focusing on the bodies which already exist , self-regulating and joint bodies in which producers , advertisers and consumers find the best methods together .
i also want to ask him if the banking supervision system needs to be adapted .
what i urge commissioners dimas and verheugen to do is to amend the definition for small and medium-sized businesses ; that is long overdue and will help some of them , but i also urge them to set up a helpdesk that will help such firms , translate for them , and actually ensure that they get help , for the ones this legislation will affect do not know to which transition period they are subject , when - and for what - they have to register , or when this or that will start to apply to them .
i am for enlarging europe !
we decided , moreover , that we do not wish any one of the candidate countries to be given special rebates , but that we place great value on equal and proper treatment for all , be they new or old members .
under the compromise , if an additive which has already been approved is altered by nanotechnology , it must be counted as a new additive and must be subjected to a new approval procedure .
nevertheless , the potential shortage of raw materials in the future should not only make us focus on solving the issue of access to raw materials .
to achieve real results , reliable indicators need to be found for policy on sustainable development .
if the commission would like to come and look at my farm , it has been farmed for 3 000 years before christ was born , and continues to be farmed .
nuclear waste should never be transported through densely populated areas .
one of the reasons for this is , of course , the lack of structural reforms in the european economy and the fact that necessary measures have been postponed for too long .
where would our democracies be and , in particular , the european democracy represented here in the european parliament , without the full participation of women in public life ?
mr president , mr rübig , i would draw your attention to the fact that the member states have been working together with the candidate countries on matters relating to the land border for years now as part of the twinning programmes between them , because the commission does not have any border guards of its own .
we do not need a bloated eu budget that is perhaps up to ten times higher than necessary ; we do not need a budget funded by the eu taxpayer that has lost any sense of the need to economise ; we do not need a further bloating of brussels bureaucracy that robs the shirts from the backs of the net contributors .
unfortunately , nothing of the kind has happened .
secondly , we want the fight against terrorism to involve seeking a balance between people’s security and people’s freedom and for us not to imitate our american friends who , in their battle against the terrorist enemy , flout the most fundamental of essential rights .
applause
for multiannual cohesion programmes , the commission is making extensive use of the interruption and suspension of payments , avoiding payments to member states where management and control systems are found not be effective .
for this reason , we oppose the blanket call for the introduction of a minimum wage in all the member states , as originally expressed in paragraph 14 of the report .
but i would like to put these questions to you and i would be grateful if they could be answered by the beginning of january .
the question is : will it just be a folkloristic declaration adopted in a convention and will the 15 again behave in exactly the same way on the night ?
i set great store by this .
we all recognise the importance of this debate and this exchange of views has clearly been influenced by the emotions caused by the dover tragedy .
the community has been very much in the vanguard of calls for this kind of approach .
i should now like to touch very briefly on other aspects of the council’s second reading , which honourable members might like to take into account .
that this country is able to use internal political debate , i.e . the imminent election campaign in the usa , to block us and the other contracting states from making further progress on this central issue is scandalous !
this therefore confirms the fear of seeing research exported in the wake of these regulations .
secondly , the language and style adopted by the german government over the last six months have at times caused me to feel ashamed in the european parliament .
łódź stands out in europe by its innovation and exceptional skills in the areas both of modern education and in the concepts introduced into business .
on a building site on a street in a european city , the position is that the excavator and the bulldozer are allowed to disgorge far more emission into the atmosphere than the lorry that takes away the rubble , even though they are equipped with the same engine .
this is the only way in which the republic of moldova 's citizens will be able to acquire the confidence they need to find a path towards stability and growth .
i welcome the western european nuclear regulators association wenra which was formed just over a year ago in february 1999 .
the council proposed restrictions both on monitoring and on the introduction of opt-outs .
finally , i turn to the issue of pilot services , an area in which the commission was very keen - and the council rather less keen - to see competition introduced .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
i propose that you listen and at the same time watch — because sometimes music is also to be seen rather than simply heard — this evidence that our european union is a synthesis of history , of talent , of youth and hence of the future .
how , though , does he think that control over the funds can be improved ?
the addicted individual needs to be actively involved in these efforts .
clearly , these are three very different cases and the solutions needed to regulate these situations will therefore also be very different .
i would like to end by saying that an element of border control relates to immigration and another which relates to crime , as you have said . i am very much in favour of combating organised crime and i would like to ask you , mr president-in-office of the council , whether , in this field and within the field of justice and home affairs , you believe you will be able to implement the european arrest warrant before the date set , as planned by this house and the council ?
people are being mercilessly persecuted , and religious freedom and freedom of speech are being curbed .
we think it is extremely important to achieve greater traceability in connection with the products that are on the internal market .
although the european capital of culture has a special attraction for people interested in culture , the european aspect has not totally caught on .
from this table , you will see that , although there has been an overall increase over previous protocols , there has been a reduction for a number of stocks .
while noting that some of the improvements made , in june , by the 'cultural affairs ' council concerned the protection of minors , telesales and the freedom of reception , among others , the decisions on quotas and subsequent developments in broadcasting in the very near future - television on demand or pay-tv , for instance - are still totally unsatisfactory .
so let us work together and try to find the right balance .
the european commission must , however , help us in this task and , of course , the measures taken the day before yesterday by the commission to limit and modify the system of generalised community preferences are not going to be of much help in handling the situations being experienced by colombia , ecuador and venezuela .
mr president , tax evasion and fraud are , unfortunately , common features of the tax systems of all european countries .
public opinion will query why our national leaders are frightened of their own shadow on europe and fearful of putting the argument for the constitution in a positive and trenchant way that embraces the european dimension .
this year , i have again included star cases in my annual report .
as regards this draft directive , i would like to emphasise the importance of encouraging a proactive approach .
in this case , we know what happened because the plane was seen , but up till now , even in the cermis tragedy , it is still not at all clear where the blame lies .
i do not really expect more from the commissioner tonight than i have heard from him privately .
an important step in the direction of greater transparency was the agreement of the new code of conduct on 2 october 1995 which provides for public access to the minutes and statements in the minutes of the council acting as legislator .
we must respect the free movement of players , and that is an important principle for us .
instead of being viewed solely as a means of helping people to get better jobs , upskilling must give them the opportunity to shape the jobs of the future and , hence , contribute actively to an innovative economy .
wahhabi islam persecutes christians and does not allow them anywhere to worship .
the credibility and efficiency of the edf depends largely on the transparency of these funds and on evidence , upstream and downstream , that they are being used appropriately .

there is something surrealistic - and in fact disgusting - about squandering money on a fully-contrived war and then handing out lucrative contracts to favourite local firms to repair the damage caused by that very war .

in the european union of 25 , 123 million people , equivalent to 27 % of the total population , live in regions with a pro capita gdp of less than 75 % of the community average ; of these , two-fifths live in regions belonging to the old member states .
unless our principles are reinforced in this way , unless the union provides itself with an ethical pillar which gives it credibility in the eyes of the general public - a pillar which , in fact can also serve as a model and a point of reference for its external relations - we run the risk of being derailed as a result of extending our policies and watering down our values .
furthermore , producers of combined heat and power of any size must have the right to gas in a free market .
i have to say that , throughout my work as rapporteur for poland , i have constantly borne in mind something which pope john paul ii said - and i am pleased to be able to mention his name here ; i have not heard it spoken this morning despite the fact that he has been at the forefront of european reunification - something he said during an interview he granted me .
in relation to this free trade agreement with south korea , as you say , there are undoubtedly many positives for europe in this agreement , but for our car-making industry , it is , and remains , a disastrous agreement .
in europe , we still have people whose livelihood depends on their work and that of their bees .
my region is an objective 2 region . that said , i would also like to point out that in the past , this house heard from leaders with a vision of the future who set courses of action leading to the growth and development of a european policy for union , based on a policy of social cohesion .
the egf is the baby here .
in the same way that the commission and parliament can not be allowed to grow indefinitely , neither can the court .
it is therefore not clear why the georgian government asked for more money , nor why the commission immediately started working to mobilise nearly eur 50 million .
as regards this particular report , i am in favour of the proposals put forward to the commission aimed at fair treatment between the sexes and equal rights at work .
as i was telling my pensioner friend , giuseppe rossi , who accompanied me to the airport at bergamo when i was leaving to come to brussels , this regulation seeks to save energy when users go home from their offices leaving their computers switched on , by putting them into sleep mode .
the legitimacy of parliament 's work is assured by 500 million european voters in a direct national election .
with the member states , we will draw attention to possible shortcomings in national systems , or necessary enforcement of the assessment .
its opposition was not as successful as it had hoped and therefore even i can vote in favour of this report .
i just want to thank the house for what i feel has been an extraordinarily constructive and helpful debate , which the commission also sees as an encouragement to pursue its present course , in which certainty of parliament 's support is a great help to us .
on 29 april , the commission opened an investigation of nine categories of textiles and clothing imports .

moreover , this needs to be transformed into an activity which is carried out in sustainable environmental , economic and social conditions .
the report concentrates on the previous year .
this is achieved by means of measures that deepen the cohesion between europeans that is vital if we are to complete the internal market and achieve the sustainable growth and development of our societies .
taking into account the gdp of ireland as it is today , i think that the figure is actually on average over the six years of the programme around 2.5 .
some people may mistakenly want to enter these expert groups to be part of the decision-making process , but expert groups are not decision-makers .
we managed to steer clear of a further debate on the ethical issue .
that has made it impossible for me to endorse the member states ' nominations .
it is in that spirit that i hope mr medina ortega 's report will be approved .
in conclusion , i congratulate the rapporteur on his initiative in addressing this very timely and important question .
particularly where families with children are concerned , air travel offers the quickest means of getting away to the sun , and the one which puts least strain on the nerves .

the commission looks forward to the finnish presidency taking forward the negotiations on the next generation of northern dimension partnerships .
elections will be held in france and the netherlands , and an important presidency , the german presidency , is coming up .
it is not enough , as the committee on agriculture proposes - and even if it is fair - to oppose the reduction in premiums for cereals .
it also condemns the use of brutal force by the police and kgb services against the protesters on election day and , in particular , expresses its indignation over a brutal attack on uladzimir niakliayeu - examples of the severe violation of basic democratic principles such as freedom of assembly and freedom of expression , as well as of human rights , and it expresses its concern at the attempts by the belarusian authorities to take into state custody danil sannikov , three-year-old son of presidential candidate , andrei sannikov , and investigative journalist , irina khalip , both of whom have been jailed since the 19 december election .
in the meantime , the commission will continue its consultations with the circles concerned , in particular the motor industry .
a credible application of the centralised procedure for marketing medicinal products can not work without this sort of approach .
we need to continue to pay attention to the needs of women and children affected by armed conflicts , and also in post-conflict situations , through programmes financing , for example , the provision of medical services for the survivors of sexual and gender violence , by working alongside civil society to promote the participation of women in building peace and security and , of course , by working closely with the united nations on drawing up the indicators that the secretariat-general has developed .
that means setting up an intellectual framework which will bring in the chinese , indians and the rest of the developing world .
madam president , this report is a technical stage in the eurocrats ' protracted efforts to develop a political , parliamentary division of the european union .
but today we are treading a path with hope , a path with visions , a path which is expected to prove very interesting along the way .
these jobs provide a lifeline to so many people living in rural areas .
given the predicted future development of trade between the eu and south korea , this will save a lot of money collected from customs duties , particularly in the chemical , industrial and pharmaceutical sectors .
in this sense , i join the proponents of this resolution in calling on the commission to prioritise the modernisation of the procurement rules and to address service concessions in order to avoid the further fragmentation of eu law on public procurement , in line with the principles of 'better law making ' .
i have stated some conditions and they are the conditions accepted by the commission .
( fi ) mr president , everyone we hear speak today says that there is a pressing need for humanitarian aid . many aid workers , however , have had to withdraw from the region because it is not safe .
today , we have to fight social segregation , and the only way to do that is through the cancellation of the debts of third world countries and those of , among others , south africa .
mr santer , it is your duty to spearhead this change in behaviour .
while we would stress that we very much welcome the political attention that the european parliament is focusing on the overall strengthening of the european union 's profile in the united nations , we consider that our reservations and objection to the part of the recommendation on the 'overarching process ' should be minuted .
i also think that it is right that we are responding after the various accidents , and that european citizens should see that parliament and the european institutions not only look after them when there has been a disaster , but that having learned these lessons , they are capable of moving forward and making progress on the legislative aspects .
on the one hand , experts from the commission will carry out an evaluation according to the regulations stated in the framework programme , which are specifically based on scientific quality , innovative nature , added community value and prospects for economic development .

nonetheless , the european union has a better opportunity than ever to develop its relations by using the ties and experiences which the baltic countries , for example , which now belong to the european union , along with other new members have previously had with the countries of central asia .
first of all , in spite of the feeling of satisfaction due to the fact that the financial perspective for 2007-2013 has been approved , it should be stressed that the setting of the general level of payments at 1 % of the european union’s gnp merely serves to meet the expectations of the most developed countries within the union , and does not deal with the challenges facing europe in the 21st century .
i should also like to make another plea for something that the north sea commission fisheries partnership has already introduced , namely letting biologists sail on fishing vessels .
eu enlargement to the western balkans is another crucial step in uniting europe and ensuring that past escalations of violence will not be repeated in the region .
the council will always ensure during accession negotiations that the community norms in force , and in particular all the international principles in the nuclear sector , are stringently observed .
the desire to defend the 'european social model ' is admirable . yet this defence can not be achieved at the expense of economic dynamism and , ultimately , the very future and quality of this social model .
the commission expects the turkish government to address this matter immediately . this incident demonstrates that there is an urgent need for political reform in turkey if that country is to move closer to the european union and its values .
they are socially vulnerable and , as i said before , although the directive applies to them already , we need to see significant improvements in its implementation .
one of the basic purposes of meda is indeed supporting economic transition and socio- economic development in the mediterranean region .
however , where the commission is to perform a legislative role by delegation , then it is only right that both branches of the legislative - the council and parliament - should be on the same footing as regards the possibility of monitoring the commission 's activity , referred to as 'call back ' .
furthermore , 1997 looks like being a very productive year for legislative work : 65 draft laws are to be presented to parliament .
i should like to thank the rapporteurs and particularly mrs klass and mrs hennicot-schoepges for their efforts in this respect .
the ultimate result of this , and what might be called an additional result , is that the agreement has also made it possible – in a sort of legal/budgetary emergency operation – to incorporate eur 120 million worth of funding for northern cyprus under heading vii and to add eur 10 million to the funding for the common foreign and security policy , bringing it up to eur 62.5 million .

pension systems fall under the competence of the member states .
i am going to be so unwise as to allow one or two personal reflections to creep into my remarks .
the establishment of closer dialogue in the area of energy policy should therefore constitute a priority , and at the same time , it will have to be shown in practice to be mutually beneficial .
each year , usd 10-15 billion is lost in revenue .
i welcome this report , in the belief that it will prove to be yet another instrument improving the information provided to consumers , thus contributing to a more transparent market in which an informed and conscious choice can be made between products , based on simple standards that are , however , scientifically and technologically justified .
i believe that this is a good day for the rule of law , i believe that it is a good day for the commission and i would suggest that it is also a good day for all the institutions of the european union including parliament .
secondly , a seminar was organised at the second meeting of the heads of acp organisations working on regional integration on 3 and 4 may this year in brussels and further seminars are scheduled to take place in the period july/september this year .
i therefore can not understand why you are now lowering yourself to the same practices .
in this context , it would be useful to reflect on how the length of the programme and the length of the current term of the institutions can be reconciled and made as uniform as possible .
the report also requires that the funds earmarked for them after 2013 be at least equal to those they are receiving in the current programming period .
an important issue , as mr kouchner said , except that we began with only two people here !
i am delighted that the european parliament has clearly adopted the report on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons .
we do not hesitate to talk about models when we are discussing social issues .
as mrs randzio-plath said , there are less than 90 days left before the euro is introduced and , in these times of economic and financial upheaval , it has been shown that the euro will provide extremely important security and stability for the euro area .
lastly , if we really want to reduce the public budgets allocated to agriculture , it is perhaps time to reopen discussions on community preference , by defining a new , updated community preference system that would allow the extra cost imposed on our agriculture sector by our high food safety , social , environmental and animal welfare requirements to be absorbed internally into the agriculture prices on the community market .
the budget 's unconditional priority is heading 1 ( sustainable growth and employment ) .
our aim as the presidency will be to seek initial reactions from member states and we will be working to secure agreement at the spring european council on the calendar and process for the negotiations .
by preparing for rehabilitation and reconstruction after a political and diplomatic situation has been achieved , which would also include participation by the eu in a temporary administration of kosovo , pending final definition of its status .
it is very disturbing to see how particular countries have so easily allowed russia to manipulate them .
it is in this spirit of integration , construction and genuine europeanism , that i am hopeful that the house will vote in favour of our report .
mr president , i would like to bring to parliament 's attention – not for the first time , perhaps – the discrimination against many university students from the 10 new accession states who are studying in the 15 old member states .
i am making this request because yesterday in this house commissioner vitorino announced two substantial amendments to the initiative , which i believe should be subject to further analysis in committee and , furthermore , this is laid down as an ordinary procedure in the rule i have mentioned .
we also need to support the european parliament in its efforts to comply with its obligations as an employer under the principle of equal opportunities .
i am even going to go further .
european investment is extremely welcome in azerbaijan , and is particularly sought after by the oil industry , the transport sector and the burgeoning construction industry .
as regards foreign policy measures , the commission is proposing to enter into commitments worth almost eur 5 billion , which is in line with 2003 levels .
i believe that today 's agreement is an extremely important one in the life of this parliament and for the future of the construction of europe .
what was said by mr van den broek and by mr henderson is very constructive .
naturally , we are on your side on this issue .
the same applies to legislation .
with regard to the discharge for 1998 and 1999 , i wonder to what extent we can hold the new commission responsible for the mismanagement of the old one .
for the first time , one can reach out in this house and touch the new europe , and this is an exciting and significant event .
what was bound to happen has happened .
i come from lubelszczyzna , a region in eastern poland that is one of the 10 poorest in the european union .
we must acknowledge and thank the president of the commission , mr durão barroso , for the efforts and steps he has taken to ensure that , during this visit , mr bush receives the president of this european parliament , which is you , mr borrell .
the commission 's response to this suggestion surprises us because it says that we lack the legal framework to enable such decisions to be taken .
the report is based on patients ' needs and not patients ' means .
this is what we must do , but how do we go about it ?
secondly , environmental considerations will play an increasingly important part over the next ten years .
there has already been progress in this respect , but we believe that efforts must continue to focus , on the one hand , on measures on work opportunities such as those based on a review of the luxembourg process , so that we may have a better system of incentives in relation to work creation .
madam president , i should like to thank the honourable members for the valuable interventions that have been made in this discussion on the important issue of the european union ' s relationship with the democratic people ' s republic of korea .
i am also very grateful to you for supporting 70 instead of 7 .
we have to take account of what can realistically be achieved , and this is why i do not feel directly concerned by the criticism which has been voiced about these kinds of issues .
we think that indeed there may be a burden but more empiricism and more reflection may have helped .
sweden has invested in education and language teaching , amongst other things , which has made sweden one of the most competitive countries , with companies such as ericsson , volvo and ikea .
for this reason , the council has developed an action programme .
the single european sky , which has given rise to so much resistance amongst the member states , is something which could also help us make aviation more effective .
the ball is in turkey ' s court .
i believe in a powerful europe that shows solidarity and i am one of the supporters of the vision promoted by the eu hungarian presidency , expressed by the slogan 'strong europe ' .
my group does , nevertheless , have a problem with the regulation .
it is imperative that we should avoid simplistic assertions that these atrocious killings are the results of religious hatred alone .
. mr president , i welcome the opportunity to speak this afternoon , but regret the need to do so because it seems not very long ago that this parliament adopted a resolution on the situation in sri lanka .
the ecu 100 million budget specified for the prince line for the transitional period - that is , ecu 38 million ( or eur 38 million as it is now ) for 1999 , 32 million for 2000 and 30 million for 2001 - seems sufficient to us to assist the efforts of the member states .
it is without doubt in the union 's interest to help russia develop a stable , democratic , prosperous society by strengthening its ties to europe .
however , i would like to be perfectly clear on this matter , ladies and gentlemen .
does his abduction without his consent ( statement by the kenyan foreign minister of 16 february 1999 ) not constitute a violation of international law - and even an act of state terrorism - and what view does the council take of such an act being perpetrated by a country which has applied for membership of the eu ?
we want more clarity ; in other words , we want to reduce the lack of clarity in the law so as to ensure the unhindered application of the principles contained in the european union 's treaties , and we want to honour the international agreements that we have concluded .
thank you very much .
the committee on the environment and the committee on transport also expressed themselves in favour of a change of this nature .
in the case of the mining sector , accidents can often have a cross-border impact .
to talk just about long-term measures is certainly a mistake , because up until the long-term measures start to work , people need to live .
work on the discharge procedure has already begun , and the questionnaire you have submitted is a comprehensive one .
and finally , there should be a migration observatory .
as has been mentioned , president grybauskait- who was formerly a commissioner and is well-informed concerning the values and laws of the eu - has herself initiated a process in which this law will be reviewed and made compatible with eu legislation .
it has been an inclusive process for which i sought input from member states ' parliamentarians , notably ms hautala and the subcommittee on human rights , as well as civil society ngos and academics .
it provides the idea of having a regulatory impact analysis on all new legislation to assess the need for it , to examine alternatives and to examine its overall impact .
first of all , though , i should like to thank mrs doyle who , as rapporteur , has taken a number of important initiatives in order to safeguard the environmental quality of these proposals , and has shown much commitment in this .
virtually everyone now agrees on the need for modernisation with trains that can travel on the other side of the border with the same carriages , the same crew , the same voltage and the same safety requirements .
for the european parliament , codecision making will increase dramatically , covering up to 95 % of the legislation in areas such as freedom , security and justice , agriculture , fisheries , research and structural funds .
there are european christians who are being repressed here in the heart of europe , and we in the european parliament can not tolerate that .
do we have the power to obtain classified cia documents if they are not handed over ?
with regard to argentina , it should be pointed out that taken together , the european union countries constitute a majority in the international monetary fund . it was within their power to generate quite a different response to the crisis in argentina .
for example , will business people who missed important appointments receive compensation ?
harbouring national ambitions is perfectly legitimate , but understanding that the game is won at international level by playing as a team is the way to guarantee a future for the people of europe .
in january , at the nabucco conference held in budapest in hungary , commissioner pielbags stated for the first time that the european union wants to offer political and financial support to the nabucco project .
most importantly , we must protect the funding of the european union 's common agricultural policy and not allow the fragmentation of the agricultural budget to the benefit of all sorts of dubious ideas .
she could not be here today and so i am speaking on her behalf and on behalf of the socialist group in the european parliament .
by supporting the motion for a resolution in its unamended form we send a signal that the political élite knows what is best for our electors .
i shall give you an example .
mr morris , the presidency is here today .
if you go out in a boat in the wonderful archipelago in summer , you are met by a decimetre-thick green , foul-smelling layer of algae .
hopefully that confidence will return .
i call on the etuc to call off the demonstration against growth , competitiveness and employment and do as the socialist group has earned our gratitude by doing – get back into the boat of growth , employment and competitiveness .
member of the commission . - mr president , this is not just a courtesy : it is always a great pleasure to listen to such distinguished lawyers talking about one of the most important things to have happened in recent years in the area of civil law .
if the revision of the directive achieves its purpose , it should also ensure that competitiveness with other means of transport is restored and that modes that emit less co2 are used .
without that loan finance , k2 and r4 will not be completed to western safety standards , but they will be completed .
it goes against every political development of europe in every direction .
because lifelong learning is a shared responsibility , national strategies must be the result of agreements at all levels , including at the local level , and between all operators , in particular the social partners .
so far , the debate has focused on three issues .
regarding mr van dam 's question , i must again point out that it is not correct to say that the european union 's and the european commission 's accounts did not meet international standards .
a number of members raised that point .
if the 'democracy and human rights ' dimension is to become an essential component of the community 's foreign and development policy , children must be the focus of our attention .
we were answered with reassuring words about the intentions of the quartet , that illusion manipulated by the bush administration to cover up its non-intervention .
why such attention ?
i call upon you to object to the us administration 's disregard and violation of such crucial international treaties , and to do so in unmistakeable terms .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , all the european institutions talk about the citizens ' europe .
the european commission could manage the technological and industrial aspects subject to competition rules .
on the whole – and i am coming back to where i began – the cooperation between parliament and the commission has been so excellent because we held a european dialogue at european level on all of these issues , between insurers , automobile associations , parliament , and associations of accident victims – i am referring here to the european transport law seminars in trier .
that is why it is important that there should be an overall discussion of what potential sustainable growth rates of wages are in each of the component parts of the euro zone economy , and why this will actually help deliver low inflation combined with low unemployment .
the european union 's policies in the education & training and external relations fields have developed and the etf regulation therefore needs to be updated to take account of those developments .
within the context of the environmental grenelle we have done a lot of work on environmental health issues and have come up against the same problems as those that you have been commenting on in one way or another .
it is also my firm belief that something must be done to rid the union of its red-tape image amongst the people of europe .
of the suggestions and requests made by the rapporteur , i wish to highlight just three aspects : firstly , mr ferri referred to the need to amend article 35 of the treaty on european union so that the court of justice of the european communities is given the power to decide whether the member states comply with their obligations .
the eu should actively seek to export its strong animal welfare and environmental standards around the world , notably through more open international markets , rather than focusing on defensive , protectionist solutions .
but just because , unlike us , it has the right of initiative , and could take initiatives to implement freedom of movement within the european union for instance , it should do so more strongly .
this instrument could also help to reduce some serious , well-known imbalances .
we are not opposed to economic aid to other countries , but believe that this type of decision should be made at national level or within the framework of the un .
i also regret the fact that the council did not reach an agreement on dual criminal liability .
why we still have a debate , without a document and without a basic text ?
the process , which is apparently still ongoing , started 12 years ago .
personally , i feel very strongly that there is a need for this .
in december the european council specifically asked you and the commission to look deeper into this issue .
we must ask the union to establish whether the proposals made by these countries under the aegis of igadd will be able to bring about a solution and if so to give them our support .
i believe some of their names are known worldwide like the ruidera lagoons , the daimiel tablas , the valencia albufera , doñana , and so on .
this budget is a bridge to the new programming period .
there is a striking diversity between member states in many aspects which should be taken into consideration : cultural , diversity in attitude and , one of the biggest difference , economic wealth , the latter being the major cause of bad quality of road , limited length of highways .
this is not an illegal act , but puts the european biofuel industry at risk .
we recognise the importance of vat as a possible way of promoting employment , but we do not support a policy in which certain sectors are promoted on an ad hoc , arbitrary basis .
i feel i must remind the house that the european commission proposal and amendments by the european parliament were submitted to it over a year ago , and so my group wishes to ask the portuguese presidency to seriously consider calling an extraordinary meeting of the council to this end .
i ask you , how often in environment debates have we heard industry coming along and saying 'this is impossible , this is the end of our industry if you do this , european union ; this is going to cost an extravagant amount , european parliament ' ?
you will not be the director as walt disney is american .
it is good that the muslim brotherhood has involved itself in the process to amend the constitution , has founded a party and will take part in elections .
new elections will take place in may and the preparations are under way .
at present , carriers are indirectly encouraging illegal immigration in that no checking of travel documents is carried out .
in writing . - ( lt ) i am delighted that since the treaty of lisbon came into force , we have made some significant achievements in the field of human rights , firstly because the european union charter of fundamental rights became legally binding , and secondly because the european union is obliged to accede to the european convention on human rights .
it is quite clear that we need to have a european defence identity and , therefore , the st malo initiative must be followed up rapidly .
they regularly do this .
in this report i propose some thirty recommendations for the council and the commission to take into account when drawing up the negotiation guidelines .
the big three running the show - is that the kind of europe we want ?
in any case , approximately eur 4.9 billion will be channelled back to the coffers of the national finance ministers .
as for the food authority itself , i must stress the importance of a clear definition of its responsibilities .
mr president , the proposal for joint action on the temporary protection of displaced persons is a good one .
ladies and gentlemen , i would urge you to reread the chapter in the report on the security office , which was set up in 1990 and was directly answerable to the commission president at the time .
it is clear that the objective of this directive is one hundred per cent environmental and everybody therefore welcomes it .
commitments were made to afghanistan and will obviously be honoured .
if the council proves incapable of acting , then the european parliament will be deeply disappointed , as no doubt will be the peoples of europe .
there were eight votes to go .
these products normally contain low-quality or falsified substances , representing a serious threat to public health , and also leading to a loss of patient trust in the legal supply chain .
quality is more important than quantity , and in this respect i would like to specifically acknowledge the quality of the monetary dialogue with the european parliament .
this is what i interpreted from the commission ' s position and what i have maintained throughout .
( pl ) madam president , i would like to congratulate mr fernandes on his excellent report .
the european continent is changing dramatically .
the date of the commission 's convergence report therefore depends , on the one hand , on when the member state presents the request and , on the other , on when the commission can be provided with the appropriate , rigorous and accurate data required in order to carry out the assessment .
it is a rather delicate and sometimes powerful instrument , but it is not an objective in itself .
.
this list is urgent , since we can not do without industrially produced feedingstuffs in the future .
the second comment is that despite the fact that the commission denies that it needs more resources , particularly human resources , to deal with infringements , the reality is that in almost all the meetings i have had with your fellow commissioners , everyone has told me that they do not have sufficient resources , sufficient people , to deal with this matter .
the central bank has basically sacrificed competitiveness , where we are lagging behind , in order to reinforce stability , where we are fine .
the committee would recommend to president maystadt three areas where the bank 's operations could become more efficient or transparent .
in 1997 , the united nations general assembly confirmed that the pact concluded within the framework of the rio conference had been almost totally disregarded .
the debate is closed .
even if i share the aim of amendments nos 1 and 26 , they are not acceptable because they request initiatives that the commission is already taking .
i fully support mr lange 's amendments and his work on what is a very technical area .
in so doing , we are giving the commission time to consider whether it might not rethink its position on amendment no 1 by january .
make no mistake , this war is about oil .
i nevertheless believe that more courage and more consistency are needed , and i say so especially in relation to the points emphasised by mrs colombo svevo .
because the european union lacks criminal law and law enforcement powers , the action plan addresses illegal content only in terms of encouraging the preparation of a study on national measures necessary .
but we can not solve these problems by talk alone .
this is why i fully support the european commission 's proposal amending the existing recommendations to make them more effective .
a duopoly will always be unstable .
what will you do , what can you do , in order to bring these important , necessary and justified demands to the attention of the council ?

it is now up to macedonia to prove to the european union that it has the will to fulfil the underlying criteria and , most importantly , this country must now show that it is in a position to resolve conflicts between ethnic groups through political dialogue rather than by force .
the only question is how we deal with it .
the egnos and galileo systems , when they are completed , will increase security in transport , using certain applications .
the major problem with the european energy strategy is that it was not built from scratch , but is rooted in each country 's own geography , history and energy economics .
it needs to be purposeful and result-oriented . madam president , mr president-in-office , you know that we in this house want a convention to prepare the next intergovernmental conference .
so what does parliament expect from this icao meeting ?
i absolutely appreciate the concerns reflected in that amendment , but a provision of that nature can not be included in a harmonising directive , as it would have financial implications for the member states disproportionate to the aim of the directive .
the same is not true of us , as we are still trying to find your question ; i have no doubt that we received it , but we can not find any trace of the letter . so , if you can help us to find it , we will do our best to provide an answer for you before the end of the year .
i know from talks with the slovenian presidency that their proposals will tend to aim for a longer rather than a shorter grace period .
in my opinion , the directive is appropriate , but in order to achieve its objective , it is important that all member states follow and comply with all elements of the directive in time and observe the deadlines .
it now looks probable that new negotiations will be started up within the framework of the world trade organisation .
changed environmental and climate framework conditions , greater use of water by business , agriculture and households , and of course changed consumption habits have exacerbated the water shortage .
the next item is the report ( a4-0169/99 ) by mrs aglietta , on behalf of the committee on institutional affairs , on the proposal for a council decision laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the commission ( com ( 98 ) 0380 - c4-0501/98-98/0219 ( cns ) ) .
this is one of the biggest areas of concern to the ordinary man or woman in the street who is the embodiment of the european union .
i think that means we have a very good policy in that area as well .
that is very important and i would like to add one further point .
( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , apart from expressing my thanks for putting pavarotti first , i should like to say something .
what i think is important when we discuss these issues as politicians is that we constantly live in the tension between the vision and the reality .
please arrange for that report 's immediate publication .
here , then , i agree with your idea : we have to scrap unanimity .
this will inevitably take time : it would be foolhardy to rush into further changes until we see how these work out in practice .
the muñiz de urquiza report contains the millán mon amendment defining parliament 's position on the issue .
all member states have supported previous reviews and support the product coverage of the fourth review .

it condemns all forms of child exploitation , as well as the worst forms of child labour .
i am glad to hear commissioner fischler tell mr byrne that more money should find its way into research , as a calamity such as the one we have witnessed in great britain must not be allowed to happen again .
the motion for a resolution calls for relatively rapid intervention by eurojust - we have verified it on several occasions - and particularly by the so-called european public prosecutor who , at least on matters of serious crime - organised crime , telematic crime , white collar crime , mafia crime , etc . can effectively take the lead .
but tobacco is not in the health check .
so for old cars we can restrict the materials that may be dumped , but not set a sub-quota on how they may be used .
the power wielded by the socialist and anti-catholic bloc in this house is cause for great concern .
however , a political agreement is now absolutely essential in the basque country , as it was in ireland , and the narrow-mindedness and reactionary attitude of the spanish government in refusing to accept a political agreement with the basque national parties within the peace process is totally unacceptable .
the european union therefore has a direct responsibility to gear its policies more closely to the baltic region as a whole , rather than to the individual states of the baltic seaboard .
as it is very likely that a considerable portion of the appropriations set aside for members ' regulations , for example , ( which amount to eur 60 million ) , will remain unspent , and as more than half the year has now gone by , this ceiling may be reviewed at the end of the year .
citizens must be able to feel they live in a free and safe europe , so the fight against terrorism and organized crime must pass from rhetoric to action .
if nothing is done , the un food and agriculture organisation ( fao ) warns that the already high consumption of meat will double by 2050 .
with regard to the first , the commission has sent us a series of proposals , contained in two directives and an action plan , which aim to apply the following decision taken by the heads of state and government in tampere . this states that 'the european union must ensure fair treatment of third country nationals who reside legally on the territory of its member states .
the ministers of internal affairs , and the national politicians too , ought , for a moment , to visualise themselves or their families having only some eur 200 to live on and having to fork out practically all of that to get a visa , a schengen visa , and a transit visa , and , in order to hand over the money , having to queue , sometimes for days or even weeks .
but this is not in the interest of portugal 's population or of workers in the strategic fisheries sector , which is now under such enormous threat .
and from the european point of view we do that with total respect for the cultural and religious traditions of our north african friends and total repudiation of the fundamentalists ' abuse of those traditions .
the manner in which some in the west seek to betray hezbollah does not deceive us’ .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
in this case , the data shows that in terms of reducing poverty , the immediate gains are considerably lower , although other benefits may accrue from the far-reaching changes taking place in the economies of our mediterranean partners .
i would like to hear the president of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection , mr kenneth collins , if he is in agreement of course .
we must , though , also be quite clear in our own minds that it is important to reintroduce friday so that thursday is made a correspondingly more attractive proposition .
we are not against immigrants but we believe that , for an honest , responsible coexistence to work , it must be stringently controlled and regulated .
some member states have already commenced with preliminary bilateral talks as to how the agreements should look , although so far nothing has been put in writing .
as we have said on several occasions in this forum , and as europêche said in a letter to you , mr borg , there is not much point in negotiating marvellous fishing opportunities - which is not the case in this agreement - if we then accept technical conditions which prevent us being able to take proper advantage of those possibilities .
i believe that this is , for the moment , sufficient indication of political affinity between its members and i can not therefore accede to your request , mr schulz .
my second point has to do with concessions .
mr bowis has thoroughly and successfully addressed all the important issues concerning a strategy for mental health in the eu and my group fully endorses his report .
mr dell'alba 's report relates to an amendment to rule 48 of the rules of procedure , which concerns written declarations .
but we have at least 10 communists in this commission and it must feel like a return to the good old days .
there are a great many diverging interests in this sector .
these are important issues and , commissioner , we say that the moment has come to be firm and set an end date so that we can successfully migrate to sepa and make this project - which is very important for the single market - truly take off .
in this situation we are faced with something that often occurs : we have to assess the safety of the observers , the situation on the ground and the political damage that might be caused by withdrawing the observers .
so this may be the last chance i have in plenary to say publicly from our side of the house that i very much enjoyed working with her .
what the discussion is about , as it was in the past and will be in future , is the factual implementation of church and state separation , in other words freedom of religion as one of the points which is , and will continue to be , closely monitored , where the developments in turkey are concerned .
that is why it is so important for us to discuss this subject today here in parliament , too .
the first is that the report takes an approach to the subject of industrial development that does not break down industrial and business interests into market sectors , but puts them together according to common objectives .
in protest , my group has decided not to vote for any amendments , even if the content of some of them have our full sympathy .
instead , we should do everything possible to make it easy for them , since there really could be a consumer revolution that would drive down prices and provide alternatives .
the document is now available on the internet on the europe home pages in the eleven official languages of the community .
today , this week , we have the opportunity to do so .
mainstreaming is not given sufficient attention either .
there is a high likelihood , therefore , of problems of the kind currently faced by parents and local-government officials in my region occurring in many other regions of europe , too , when one looks more closely .
at some point , there will be a sort of oettinger seal of approval on the old reactors which will certify that tests have once again been carried out on paper of all the things that have often been tested before .
the debate is closed .
these commitments are : that the member states are free to use all the clauses allowing them to produce generic medicines and export them to developing countries , and not only to poor developing countries ; that these developing countries can use all the flexibilities in the doha declaration to provide their populations with the essential medicines they need ; that the european union will not negotiate public health-related provisions in negotiations on trade agreements - and i also note the statements by the commissioner ; and finally that the eu will finance projects to develop research and manufacturing capabilities in these countries .
the fact that 500 , 000 women are estimated to be being trafficked in the european community is an appalling figure .
the rapporteur is , therefore , quite right in calling for the principle of subsidiarity to be strictly observed in implementing the esdp .
mr president , i just wish to make the point that some of us are here at 9 o'clock for the night sittings and know exactly who comes to these night sittings !
if eu member states do not show much interest in these partnerships , which is borne out by the aforementioned fact that only four member states have ratified the cotonou agreement , parliament should do so , particularly because relations with these countries are based , according to the new agreement , on political dialogue , of which the parliamentary assembly is a fundamental pillar .
we need to think very carefully about this directive .
we are concerned with structural problems in greece and spain , and in particular in germany , in the land of mecklenburg-vorpommern .
fourthly , even the pension problems remain unsolved .
this amount would be in addition to member states ' commitments , constituting a fund to help offset the widest possible range of economic and social consequences that the european union fisheries management decision will inflict .
president-in-office of the council . - ( sl ) in my concluding statement i would also like to emphasise that the council is aware of the difficult position of the fisheries sector in the european union , but two aspects need to be distinguished : one is the specific features of the fisheries sector , and the other is the high prices of fuel , which as already stated are affecting numerous , practically all sectors , including of course fisheries .
the latter have not been attained in iraq or in the middle east , where it is difficult to talk of success , although the situation in afghanistan has already improved somewhat .
although the european convention on human rights has been mentioned , the conclusions do not state in so many words that echelon violates citizens ' rights .
indeed , it could be useful , precisely because this is a new process which we need to improve .
the suggestion mooted in the court of auditors’ report , namely that certification bodies be established for all the components of the budget other than agriculture , strikes me as one that needs further exploration .
we know that huge amounts of money will be needed to repair the financial situation of these businesses .
i believe it was very fitting that john hume , who has played a most significant role in getting the peace process to where it is today , should have been our main speaker .
in my opinion every one of us should bear responsibility for financing the eu .
we never use it for any purpose , including to obtain information .
however , i would caution , perhaps , that the conference of presidents remembers the - perhaps wise - advice of mr cohn-bendit not to give these people the prominence they seek through their quite unacceptable behaviour .
where is the dutch commitment to greater democracy ?
these directory company practices are also clearly outside the law , according to the directive on misleading and comparative advertising .
he had no objections to international assistance and monitoring , nor to the presence of international observers during the elections .
we are against the gats and in favour of designating world public goods as outside the scope of the market .
it follows that if permitting the marketing of chocolate-flavoured products containing up to 5 % of substituted vegetable fats in all member states is desired , it is difficult for me to accept that these products have exactly the same name as 100 % cocoa products .
it is very clear that , as emu takes a hold within the union , the reduced cost of doing business and the elimination of transaction costs will ensure that european union businesses become more competitive .
( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , when debating foreign policy issues , such as today 's issue involving iran , there is always the risk , as we know , of lagging slightly behind the events taking place .
let us first put it to the vote leaving out the word 'bannissement ' and the names .
nevertheless , having analysed the commission 's proposals , i can not hide my enormous disappointment .
that is not because we are the centre of the world .
under the draft agreement , the parties undertake to promote responsible fishing in the comoros fishing zone based on the principle of non-discrimination between the different fleets fishing in this fishing zone .
thus , consumers looking for a more authentic and more natural product will easily be able to find it on the shelf under the clear name 'fruit juice ' , knowing that they are prepared to pay the price corresponding to the specific qualities associated with this product , while consumers inclined towards a more standardised and cheaper product will be able to turn with full knowledge of the facts towards a juice made from concentrate without any ambiguity about its nature and particular characteristics .
the commission can also support very many of your amendments , either as drafted or in spirit , where we need to adapt the wording .
all of us must feel affected in the depths of our soul by the strength and lucidity which have made you the symbol of all those israelis who are campaigning for a peace which will take into account the aspirations of two peoples , the people of israel and the people of palestine .
moreover , as others have also said , the new eu 2020 strategy can be successful only if we really achieve sound european economic governance .
they are problems and challenges which fall to us because of our successes .
in this respect we have voted against paragraph 9 ( original text ) and amendment no 4 ( a ) ( new ) which introduces punitive measures .
the practical implications of the article are disputed .
nevertheless , the treaty does not set explicit time limits for the member states to comply with that obligation .
demonstrators clashed with police for hours in the streets , leading to arrests and injuries .
the vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m .
equally , it is important to have tax incentives for energy saving : there i share his point of view .
we are being fobbed off with promises of a data protection supervisor , when it is not even clear what supervisory powers they actually have .
all of these issues illustrate how we as a political group - how all political groups - can add value to the stockholm programme and can create legislation which is meaningful .
there are not many amendments and i can see no reason at all for delaying any further this report .
let the commissioner and the president-in-office of the council then reply and we will then suspend the sitting and resume at 9 p.m .
the 18 million unemployed will not accept a situation where the european union takes on new problems before it has solved the problem of employment .
the european council set out key measures required to make it a reality .
incidentally , to emphasize the difficult aspects of economic change , for example , i should like to quote lech walesa , who is supposed to have said , ' anybody can change an aquarium into fish soup , but changing fish soup into an aquarium takes a miracle .
so it would be important finally to implement the provisions that were once discussed in iata , and to restrict hand luggage to one piece .
next week , a political debate , but one that includes technical aspects too , will be held at the european parliament building in brussels .
i refer on the one hand to the need to improve the commission 's efficiency in achieving its priority tasks and on the other hand the ambition to create some sort of eu diplomatic service .
i think that this is an important condition for developing new skills and their self-awareness of their european identity .
mr president , i thank each and every one of you for your expressions of support and your comments , and that includes those who opposed the report , by the way .
prime minister , you also have to your credit an agreement on reach , an agreement on the services directive , on which thankfully - whatever mr schulz says - we defeated all the socialist rapporteur 's amendments , an agreement on next year 's budget and an agreement to bring bulgaria and romania into our union .
similarly productivity has to be improved and new means of work-sharing has to be found .
such a similar result will only come out of this european convention , if we as a parliament are bold , well-organised and persuasive .
under no circumstances , and on no account , must specific characteristics of high-quality products that enhance the value of regional traditions be renounced in order to mass-produce these products , which become commonplace and are shaped by the constraints of the global market .
it should be talking much more about deregulation , not about how we can go forward with a common immigration policy .
in order to counter this unacceptable situation , government needs to step in with stronger regulation and resourcing of the relevant consumer protection agencies .
likewise , i believe it is impossible for mankind to control what nuclear energy will do .
are you for or against it ?
madam president , presidents , ladies and gentlemen , as we have learned here in parliament , in the alternation of presidencies what is important is not so much which country is in office or the abilities of its leading representatives as the underlying dynamic of the state of the union .
it is about the fact that the open coordination method is also a cooperation , and not only a coordination , method .
mr president , commissioner , i also wish to thank the rapporteur on his work for a new organisation of the market .
it is important that the number of organisations dealing with the roma increases each year , and that they become the driving force of the enforcement of the rights of roma throughout europe .
in any case , the supervisory authorities responsible for implementing the regulations must be required to set up a system of checks and sanctions which is both effective and acts as a deterrent .
i know it was perhaps somewhat disappointing for you that we felt we were not able to give this proposal a thorough review and get it to first reading before the end of this mandate .
not surprisingly , newcomers then see little with which to identify .
thirdly , how does the austrian presidency view and plan to approach relations with the countries of latin america , and what preparations does it intend to make , in agreement with the german presidency , with a view to the forthcoming summit of the heads of state and government of the eu and latin america ? what role does it intend to give the european parliament in that summit , given that parliament participates in the internal summits of eu heads of state and government as everybody knows ?
it is an impressive administrative and technical piece of work , which deserves the greatest credit .
consider your responsibilities rather than seeking to challenge universal suffrage in ireland , or anywhere else .
for citizens and farmers are entitled to expect the authorities to respond effectively to a crisis of this kind and although it may not be appropriate to term a natural disaster , it comes very close to one when you see what the effects are .
if this can be achieved , smes could have easier access to new markets .
the forum 's report is expected to contain three main sections . a confirmation of the principles agreed at international and european level , an analysis of the factors which hamper and the factors which contribute to the success of corporate social responsibility and a series of recommendations on corporate social responsibility for the attention of the members of the forum or the institutions of the european union and other agencies .
equality between parliament and council is the key to this .
not only does this help europe not to lose women 's talent and presence in the workforce but it also contributes to facing the present demographic challenge and ensuring children 's healthy physical , emotional , and mental development .
we shall now move on to the debate .
relatives in the ascending line , when these people are in the applicant ' s care as well as children of full age who are also dependants .
my group will approve the resolution .
that is not something that i ask other speakers .
some national ecas do not even report the overall balance of their annual operations regularly .
this does not alter the fact , though , that in 2007 , there is still much interference on the line where the issue is concerned of who is responsible for rescuing people from drowning , whether they are legal or illegal .
the group of the european people 's party ( christian democrats ) supports this report and we congratulate both rapporteurs , mr corbett and mr martin .
the union remains fully committed , for example , to delivering on the kyoto protocol target .
together we need to create a society where people have control over their daily lives .
this is a laudable and tangible first step in the fight against a dreadful development , which is being further exacerbated by the economic and financial crisis in asia .
i will have to make further remarks on the resolution .
however , i think we have been shown a way forward , and we are going to try to do it .
( el ) mr president , the tragic floods which hit the autonomous region of madeira remind us that natural disasters caused by climate change , a lack of planning and infrastructures and a lack of information and readiness can develop into a human tragedy , as has happened here .
i do not think that the european union is doing enough to help farmers ; and i am not talking about the grants - the grants are good .
i would like , however , to extend the topic slightly by referring to the children who remain at home while their parents have gone off to work abroad .
i am delighted that we have succeeded with the rapporteur and numerous other members in finding a good , common line on most aspects of this very demanding subject and would like to thank them for that .
we all agree on the fact that it needs to be done and why it is necessary .
we know our history : more than 500 000 roma were killed in the death camps .
i sometimes think we could be more flexible in applying this order of precedence , since it may well be that technical environmental assessments indicate that it is better for the environment in some cases to depart from the order of the list .
this , unfortunately , results in 50 % of petitions being inadmissible .
a simplifying treaty could have tackled the real issues : relative economic decline , fraud and waste , and greater involvement of national parliaments in the decision-making processes .
the problem , therefore , is in the interim period and what will happen with the sewage sludge which is currently being dumped at the ano liosia landfill using a partial soilification procedure , which is at the pilot stage at present , whereby the material produced can be used either to cover the landfill or to reinforce the ground in certain areas .
what i would like to know is why he has no intention of repeating the exercise .
but there is another reason why we must hope that you succeed in implementing your planned reforms and parliament 's recommendations : our vote of confidence at the end of the year will depend on it .
the strategy of deterrence may therefore have its merits .
from october 2005 - that is , two months before the launch of the sunrise period - the registry published on its website and in all the official languages a detailed description of all technical and administrative measures concerning the registration procedures .
i would like to thank very warmly the insurance undertakings .
mr president , i , too , would like to congratulate mr rosado fernandes on his report and would like to add , in connection with the tobacco crop produced in objective 1 regions - the european union 's poorest regions - that we should not speak demagogically of crop substitution .
we should highlight the positive effect of this proposal , which promotes debate on a crucial subject , with the ultimate aim of combating falsified medicinal products .
what is crucial is who monitors the food producers .
we are here until 1 p.m. , yet when we indicate that we want to speak , we are suddenly told there is no more speaking time , even though we are stopping before 11 a.m. !
the eu has these means available to it , and they – and not the military resources – should be increased .
i look forward to the meeting to be held shortly with the court of auditors and the committee on budgetary control to see what we can do to assist each other in this joint exercise .
this is also why i fully support the commission 's proposal to have the national budgets inspected in advance by the eu , with the proviso , however , that the national parliaments and the european parliament are involved in these inspection arrangements .
might it not have something to do with the lamentable fact that we in europe , represented by spokesmen , some of whom we have already been able to hear here today , have got ourselves stuck in an ideological fight to the death about what the european central bank’s primary purpose is meant to be , rather than taking a more pragmatic approach ?
i believe that we will have to carry on talking a lot over the coming months in our committee in order to find genuinely european compromise formulae .
on closer study , however , we see that unemployment has fallen to a lesser degree than the economy has grown in the same period .
i will do the same here today for the last time .
in the light of this , in particular , we can not but support the commission 's initiative .
in view of the fact that the report wholeheartedly supports federalism as the right course of action for the european cooperation , i have voted against it .
who else should be bringing about change , if not the commission , which is responsible for ensuring that things like this do not happen in european waters .
again , is there a minimum number of names that have to have a cross put against them in order for the voting paper to be valid , or is it valid if you put a cross by 2 , 3 , 4 or 8 – or indeed any other number ?
the use of roads causes damage to them .
the commission , on behalf of the european community , and the ten member states that concluded the anti-contraband and anti-counterfeit agreement with philip morris international , will decide how the funds are to be shared out .
madam president , today , many of the challenges we face do not respect borders , either political or administrative .
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on thursday , 20 november 2003 .
it is not possible to set thresholds in a small country such as mine where a small brewery can dominate , but in a very limited market , whereas a major brewery such as 'bitburger ' , which is just next door to us and which is in a much stronger position and has a much bigger turnover , is not considered to be dominant because germany is huge in comparison with the grand duchy of luxembourg .
i propose that we do this as quickly as possible , given that the treaty can enter into force from the moment that it has been ratified by sufficient parties .
that does not strike me as a good example of effective legislation .
they have voiced their concerns about the purpose of european integration , about the way in which europe is run , about the future of the agricultural policy , about the wto negotiations , about the tax policy .
mr president , the commission 's proposal for a european parliament and council regulation on the granting of community financial assistance to improve the environmental performance of the freight transport system has much to recommend it .
will europe manage not to turn the allfamous convergence into a linchpin of diluting european unity and a foundation of euroscepticism ? will it manage not to make millions of jobless the victims of the logic of numbers and international competition ?
it is therefore all the more important that we , as a parliament , get it implemented and make the council and the commission put their money where their mouth is .
( fr ) mr president , please excuse me , i may be mistaken but i thought that when votes were about people they had to remain secret , which has not been the case .
on behalf of the ppe-de group . - ( nl ) mr president , commissioner , organ transplants do indeed save human lives in europe every day .
other than that , the principles in the report are fine .
bulgaria has shown a conscientious attitude in its use of the funds for decommissioning the plant by 2009 .
the vote will take place on thursday , 29 november 2007 .
i ask you to bring us a new proposal , one offering the possibility of broader support for the commission .
i should also like to say , however , that the purpose of introducing resale rights is to enable practitioners of the visual arts to benefit from the subsequent financial success of their works .
even a constitutional debate offers an opportunity to people with that parochial mentality , people who are incapable of grasping what is at stake .
i am therefore not opposed to the vote being delayed for another month .
after a 13-month break , the stabilisation and association agreement ( saa ) negotiations between the serbian government and the eu resumed .
they are the european institutions : parliament , the commission and even you , mr van rompuy , because i think that you do not represent the council in the sense that you defend its interests but you are the man that can make the council understand which ideals to focus on .
in writing . - with this , the ep firstly welcomes the commission 's proposal to open negotiations on the renewal of the protocol between the eu and the islamic republic of mauritania , while underlining that it should be maintained only if it is mutually beneficial , adjusted appropriately and implemented correctly ; secondly , welcomes the commission 's proposal to introduce a human rights clause ; thirdly , insists that any and all access negotiated for eu-flagged vessels to fish in mauritanian waters must be based on the principle of surplus stocks as described in the un convention on the law of the sea ; emphasises , in particular , that there must be a rigorous assessment of all stocks for which access is sought or which are likely to be caught by the eu fleet as by-catch ; stresses that any access granted to the eu must relate to those resources which are unable to be caught by the mauritanian fleet ; emphasises that , should effort reductions be necessary , those third-country ( eu and other ) fleets causing the most environmental damage must be the first to make reductions ;
firstly , the matter of the duration of the financial regulation .
rapporteur . - mr president , after our previous debate i am glad to see that we are still friends and that we can reach a wider consensus on these issues .
this failure is all the more damning because it affects the main community institutions , the council and the commission .
madam president , you will remember perfectly that , at the last plenary part-session which we held here in brussels , all the political groups , without exception , condemned the murder of the basque socialist member of parliament , fernando buesa , at the hands of eta .
for these reasons , our task is to extend our hand in peace , justice and reconciliation , to try and solve our problems through negotiation and compromise so that these areas and all the peoples who call them home can share and be blessed by the same prosperity and guarantees of security enjoyed by the rest of georgia today .
this is much better than an approach based on the intensity of production and also serves to strengthen the position of the competent authority .
since january 1996 the dutch government has granted tax concessions to maritime companies formerly under the dutch flag or based in the netherlands .
we therefore need to ask ourselves if this is the society that we wish to create , where the authorities shoot first and ask questions later .
but some people here do not even want to mention that .
it is also important that these new proposals from the commission allow for a right to take cases to the courts .
