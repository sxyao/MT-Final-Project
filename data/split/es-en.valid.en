mr president , we politicians often talk about the future and i believe there will be time to fight the battles and overcome the obstacles we face , but i believe that today we have meditated on the past , on monnet and spinelli , and i would ask that we take pleasure in the present .
according to the analysis carried out by the commission 's legal service , this decision will fundamentally change neither the development nor the assessment of the infringement procedures in this area .
enlargement could have gone ahead all the same , based on the old treaty .
but amendment no 3 is the crux of the debate : the movers say that the european union should not proceed without the guarantee of adequate standards in procedural law .
as expressly requested when these measures were discussed , the commission is closely monitoring the market , including the export market , and the budgetary situation in this sector .
why are there 15 paragraphs on freedom of religion , primarily focusing on christians , and only six paragraphs on freedom of expression ?
therefore , it is not a question of there being less competition , but of fairer competition which is given greater support by the european courts .
mr president , firstly i would like to thank the rapporteur , mrs thors , and the draftsman of the opinion of the committee on industry , external trade , research and energy , mrs corbey , for their hard work on this legislative proposal , on which we are close to a first-reading agreement , following a swift and constructive interinstitutional dialogue .
similar violence led to some 2000 deaths .
i wish you much success in bonn .
in addition , if we really want to set to work on achieving the eu 2020 objectives , we simply can not afford to just desert people .
it works both ways .
british conservative meps urge the parliamentary authorities to ensure that future reports of this kind are under the stewardship of someone who will take a less personal and more objective approach .
i refer here to rule 2 of the rules of procedure .
section iii - commission
who , indeed , with the exception of my elected colleagues of the national right , rejects such subservience ?
madam president , eager for foreign investment vietnam has signed a cooperation agreement with europe and did so last year .
these people will see the need for law and order and political representation .
our objective is , indeed , to join with the other institutions , notably parliament , in better targeting the priorities each year and placing them in the context of europe 's overall efforts .
public anxiety about nuclear power , nuclear material and matters associated with these must always be taken with the greatest seriousness .
composition of committees and delegations : see minutes
obviously , when one chooses to be the president of a country and has the responsibility of the presidency of the union for six months , if one does not like problems or difficulties it is better not to be european and not to be involved in politics .
this was a concession won by the british .
we must beware of being so ambitious that the project will become untenable .
recital c and paragraphs 1 ( c ) and 12 read as though some would like to postpone enlargement , but we favour the timetable adopted .
the commission proposal seeks to resolve the problem of the continuing lack of liability for primary products in agriculture , and i welcome it .
i wonder , taking into consideration what the president-in-office has stated in relation to initiatives that have been taken , whether or not pressure can be put on the multilateral lenders to reschedule debts to assist those countries .
yet we now have an alternative as indicated in this report by mrs andré-léonard which is heading in the right direction .
– mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the continual rise in oil prices is again bringing home to us our economic dependency on third states .
these reservations were in the areas of protectionism - specifically relating to national preferences under the guise of the 'frugality plan ' or to problems in channels of commerce - intellectual property , respect for human rights and , above all , the failure to comply with minimum labour rules .
the fact that we can now take the definitive vote on agenda 2000 is not just a matter of course .
in my opinion , in the case of member states ' failure to enforce legislation , we should follow the legal infringement procedures that we follow , and it is the court which decides on the fine .
ladies and gentlemen , i do not see this as giving the united states , as some would have us believe .
poland supports the admission of ukraine to the european union .
quite the reverse : only we europeans are targeted ad nauseam .
no member state should feel obliged to do more than it feels is right .
we should be proud of the common text which we will be adopting tomorrow and which we were able to adopt in the conciliation committee .
mr president , the mpf delegation members approve both the 'solidarity and cooperation with the united states ' and the 'european policy ' headings of the action plan against terrorism adopted by the extraordinary european council of 21 september .
mr president , the new social action programme for 1998-2000 proposed by the commission is securely based on the guidelines for employment as agreed at the european councils of amsterdam and luxembourg .
i believe that storing rainwater for future use instead of letting it go down the drain is a good strategic solution not only in the us but also in europe .
i am in favour of a system that makes it possible to reconcile safety requirements with the need for recourse to wet leasing in exceptional circumstances and for a limited period .
this morning , i was at a big event in frankfurt , along with several hundred others .
this makes it a very important document in the discussions on the subject of belarus .
the benefits of low-cost air travel have been felt over a much wider area than just around charleroi .
i should like to emphasise , though , that the eib’s independence must be maintained and that the eib must focus on areas where it has added value .
so here we are , one month before the adoption of the legislation , which means , mr bouwman , that i do not have any facility to take the member states to court .
attention must be paid to the consequences of the agreement for the small-scale farmers of the region and to monitoring and ensuring that family and sustainable agriculture are reinforced .
we have some concerns about hungary 's media law .
what we need is an accurate account of what was decided yesterday at the conference of presidents .
the only question that remains to be answered here , relates to the financing of the court of auditor ' s new building in luxembourg .
there is absolutely no reason , absolutely no justification , why we should allow in the interests of free trade that the canadians and russians import furs into the union that would be illegal if trapped here .
in such circumstances even the smallest step towards a closer association of arms industries must be avoided .
it calls therefore on the european commission and the member states to further develop the potential offered by the different maritime sectors by drawing up an ambitious 'blue growth ' strategy .
mr president , my group would like to welcome the annual legislative programme . however , we have some concerns about the process .
however , we are concerned by certain aspects of the report such as : the call for new legal bases in eu law and the request for a decision on the `` full communitarisation of policies '' .
the hungarian presidency has presented a comprehensive list of priorities .
but this is a union of friends - friends , equals and partners .
mr president , honourable members , the copenhagen summit was a great triumph , a success both for the new member states and for the european union , a success for all those who have worked for so many years to enable the enlargement to take place , adding the new member states , the candidate countries in eastern europe , malta and cyprus .
on the other hand , the motion still has some deficiencies regarding foreign and security policy , in particular , with regard to the fight against international terrorism .
overall , i think that it is a great step forwards in terms of freedom of movement , of reducing the possibility of fraud and of attempting to improve road safety .
we should therefore help it in this regard through cooperation - and indeed also critical cooperation - based on trust .
all conclude that up to 2 000 lives a year could be saved and 20 000 serious injury accidents could also be prevented if this new directive to make cars safer when involved in collisions with pedestrians and pedal cyclists becomes law .
protests
we also need to encourage the development and use of clean technologies at a global level .
. – mr president , as rapporteur , i should like to echo mr papayannakis’ request and call for the vote to be moved from tuesday to wednesday , the reason being the problems caused by the amendments not having been translated into a number of languages .
what action is the eu taking in terms of flexible reconstruction to prevent a recurrence of what we saw happening after hurricane mitch – a yawning chasm emerging between emergency aid on the one hand and structural aid on the other ?
at the time , we rightly stressed that it was not sufficient to have a year in which we frequently used the word ‘disabled’ and then did nothing about it .
as a result of this i have instructed the commission departments to send you immediately , mr president , copies of studies , reports and other relevant material .
another matter that needs to be raised is the recognition of the genocide perpetrated against the armenian population .
we would like to know , however , under what status we have been called , since the presidency announced that the ind-dem group had excluded us , using a procedure that was totally incomprehensible and completely irregular .
is there anything for sale locally in the region ?
member of the commission . mr president , honourable members , the white paper on financial services policy 2005-2010 sets out a roadmap for opening up europe 's fragmented retail financial services markets .
in this instance , we are talking about the payment market , and it is regrettable that the decisions we have taken are being implemented rather slowly .
we called for , and voted in favour of , the disarmament of hezbollah , and also asked the council to act along those lines .
however , the council can accept the amendments you made to the letter of amendment no 2/2 000 as well as the maximum rate of increase which results from your second reading .
this is , after all , quite serious : bosnia is about to join and with these radical muslims ...
we also support the focus on prioritizing emission standards and drawing up quality criteria as a supplementary convergence instrument .
i would like to believe that things will change this time , and that priority will be given to the interests of millions of eu citizens and of small and medium-sized entrepreneurs .
so give serious thought to that before you vote .
as parliament knows , the commission has also taken a number of initiatives in this field , such as the eu 's information programme for the european citizen which was launched in 1996 , and the carolus programme for the exchange of civil servants between member states ' administrations .
in a situation where one of the parties to a dispute is inclined to go beyond the rules and to impose its interests by force , it is necessary to mobilise international institutions in order to convey a clear verbal message that the world wishes to live under stable political conditions and does not wish to see disputes settled through the use of military force .
there are many other examples , including mrs haug 's contribution , which also related to critical remarks about the agencies , highlighting , for example , that only two of the agencies are completely independent of eu grants , while most of them are financed exclusively from eu funds - that is in one of mrs haug 's documents .
the customs authorities in many countries are still in the age of paper and manual processing , having totally failed to make the technological transition to the demands of modern society .
they think we are the weakest link , and the signal we are sending them is that they are absolutely correct .
not one single time !
i should like to tell you , mr tarabella , that the commission has recorded more than 5 500 letters linked to air passenger rights . these letters are handled carefully .
facts like these only begin to illustrate how far matters of location alone can place islands at a competitive disadvantage .
i understand all the feelings expressed .
i ask you , commissioner , to do everything in your power to prevent our technology from being sold off to others .
a meeting with the american diplomat christopher hill resulted in the prime minister agreeing after all to release kem sokha and pa nguon teang on bail , which happened on 17 january , but the charges of defamation against them and a number of others who were freed were not dropped .
i have proposed a special amendment , amendment no 3 , which is based on the idea that competition must take place through socially acceptable methods .
although in almost all countries around the world the concept of human rights has been written into constitutions , international treaties or political discourse , the day-to-day reality proves that such virtuous proclamations are far from the facts .
poland has the longest external border in the european union and yet , ironically enough , its citizens can not move freely across the territory of the whole union at the moment , because sis ii is not ready .
thank you very much .
migrants will not be entitled to receive any outstanding wages before they are deported , nor will they be allowed to wait for their pay in the european union .
the member states can be tougher in the action they take .
on the other hand , it unacceptably ties the enlargement of the european union to that of nato . the resolution expresses satisfaction with the conclusion of the agreements on liberalising agricultural trade and urges further privatisation , bearing in mind current and future obligations within the wto , whereas , in social terms , it opens the way for transitional periods in the free movement of people , thereby covering the german and austrian positions , which we reject , of preventing workers from candidate countries obtaining legal status for seven years , .
secondly , i would like to say that the method of self-regulation in the banking area that we have chosen for sepa is a method in which the organs work well and several hundred banks have joined the sepa area in a very short space of time .
can the council state what steps it intends to take in the fight for greater equal opportunities across the eu ?
i do not doubt that it is necessary to build up networks and produce analyses and studies .
the commission is planning to create a legal framework next year for fund mergers .
the first is that it is right and vital for the european investment bank to become involved , but there should be no new shadow budget outside the european budget in the long term - that is unacceptable .
we must rid ourselves of that burden and implement the social agenda .
i assume that parliament will be discussing it during the next session .
a substantial part of this compensation package is to support the greenland economy and the desperately poor inuit population of greenland .
what , then , are we to think of the high vat rates on children 's clothing - from 7 % to 22 % in poland ?
let us add solidarity to this list .
the cooperation between the committee on budgets and the committee on agriculture was open and really quite constructive .
in the commission 's view , the detention of mr hu jia places an obligation on the eu to act in a firm manner because of the clear inference that he was arrested as a consequence of speaking freely and honestly about the repression of human rights defenders via a telephone link to a meeting of the european parliament 's subcommittee on human rights in november 2007 .
in regional policy in particular , i should therefore like to draw a distinction between two phases : the phase of determining the development strategy , where greater involvement on the part of authorities below the state level is desirable – provided that it is compatible with the constitutional system of the member state concerned – and then the implementation phase .
now we must take action and - i am saying this after the consultations with the americans - this will put us in a better negotiating position and on an equal footing , which will enable us to improve security and the rights of citizens in the european union and perhaps even in the us .
however , it also creates a new situation , to which industry and national legislators will have to adjust .
we must not just focus on wages but also talk about the development of inequalities , because - and i shall link this to the final idea i wish to mention in this debate - the citizens ' perception of the euro is a significant element of their perception of europe and the idea of europe .
mr president , mr medina ortega , i really must admit that you are wasting no time in putting forward the interests of these regions here in parliament , given that the treaty has only been in force for four or five days .
in the event that some regions need more time , i believe it is incumbent on both parties to seek to ensure that acp exports to the eu should not be harmed .
madam president , quite honestly , this debate gives me mixed feelings .
even at the main hearing , the court does not consider the evidence but only 10 so-called legal bars to surrender .
it was a very difficult situation in the council , because some member states do not produce an environmental balance sheet and we first need to create a foundation in all 27 member states .
the stockholm programme should also clearly take the perspective of the victims of crime .
at the same time , however , it is equally clear that major efforts still are required to overcome the differences of opinion on the content of a general ban on antipersonnel mines and the way such a ban should be implemented .
( the president cut off the speaker )
we withdrew our demand for the application of the subsidiarity principle in return for the deletion of the references to natural optical radiation , which were not replaced by anything else .
i am sorry that i had to read these two texts out , but i was required to do so .
we must certainly emphasise that .
the report provides member states with new ideas for dealing with their own pension systems in order to make them more satisfactory .
to exclude certain aspects is to practise censorship , to deliberately withhold knowledge and to fail to respect individuals ' capacity for free choice .
rapporteur . - ( fr ) mr president , this evening we are debating the erasmus mundus 2009-2013 programme , on which we have finally come to an agreement with the council .
the world , in short , is a patchwork , humanity is a patchwork and each one of us is a patchwork .
proof of this lies in the reports that have been tabled here today . however good they may be , and for that we can thank the rapporteurs , they still do nothing more than list the many cases in which fundamental rights are giving cause for concern .
( de ) commissioner , you rightly pointed out that the enforcement of legal provisions is at least as important as their enactment .
i have formed the impression that today 's debate is to some extent geared to defending the former government , which is no longer in office at all .
secondly , for certain categories of gmos , there is proof that serious or irreversible risks do exist .
with regard to the question of the roma people , which was raised here , i would like to say for my own part that i think it is right to focus attention on human rights , both generally and , in particular , regarding the rights of minorities , both in the european union , but especially in those countries seeking membership .
the member states affected must benefit as appropriately as possible from the money allocated for tackling situations which restrict economic activity and have social ramifications .
we ought always to remember that in order to be successful and have a positive impact on the social fabric of developing countries , effective integration and economic growth must necessarily be accompanied by an improvement in people’s general living conditions .
furthermore , we are concerned at the objective of defining the fight against terrorism as a central political priority , thereby disregarding the necessary consideration of its root causes such as , for example , the resolution of the conflict in the middle east or in the western sahara , in the framework of the un resolutions , or providing a response to the most basic needs and shortages that affect many populations , guaranteeing economic development and improving social conditions in the countries of the mediterranean .
therefore , i believe there is no need to be concerned that the council is withholding information on any subject whatsoever . the council believes wholly in the need to respect the union 's fundamental rights and it believes wholly in the need to respect parliament , which is the representative of the people of europe .
nevertheless , it is worth calling strongly for the achievement of a number of fundamental objectives , strongly underscored in the report , which would help to secure more tangible and , above all , better opportunities for european women .
while we may not be satisfied , we shall vote in favour of the directives on account of the extremely tight deadlines : exceeding them would render the directives meaningless .
if you argue that scientists have found that there are no reservations about genetically modified plants , that says nothing about the real dangers : it merely says something about the way science works .
but the house should be aware that we have some way to go to achieve our ultimate aim of total peace and a normal society in northern ireland .
ireland , with healthy economic growth , continues to demonstrate how to gain maximum benefit from eu membership , while scotland lags behind in terms of job opportunities and is suffering a decline in population .
it has to improve the implementation of common targets and to make an impact clearly felt by our citizens along this important european artery , which , as a colleague pointed out , has also been heavily hit by the present crisis .
the entire accession process has been characterised by other requirements that we feel are unacceptable , such as discrimination as regards the movement of workers and equal access to community funding , and the existence of unilateral safeguard clauses that can be activated against the interests of these countries , and only these countries .
in this spirit , i hope that with your help , a task group could be formed - or we could call it something else - to bring together the main institutions and key actors in the fight against cancer , not with the intention of creating a new bureaucracy , but in order to achieve better combined results owing to good methods of cooperation .
what we are doing here is preparing parliament for that time .
we can see that the health consequences affect not only people living in the vicinity but also cattle and , of course , the users of the phreatic nappes , because they can no longer drink the water they contain .
finally , in the interests of clarity and legal certainty , and also to avoid certain technical problems , the individual justifications of amendments should remain the responsibility of their authors and , consequently , should not be put to the vote .
however , i feel that we have achieved a very good result .
postal services do not provide simply a postal delivery service but also a social service .
madam president , i would firstly like to thank the representatives of the council and the commission for their speeches , and point out that when our delegation of meps visited washington , members of the us congress asked us for help in neutralising and paralysing the neo-conservative and , in some ways , almost fascist , tendencies of the bush administration .
why did we fight together at the gatt negotiations for the principle of cultural exception ? was it not so that we could make europe an area in which we could broadcast our own cultures through our own camera images and our own music , in front of a television audience of 370 million today , and one that may be 500 million tomorrow ?
president of the commission . - mr president , this european council takes place at a very important moment for our neighbourhood , namely egypt , tunisia and belarus .
mr president , a bit less fraud here , a bit more fraud there .
it seems to me that since then the commissioner , mr liikanen , and the officials and commissioners responsible have spared no efforts in attempting to respond to the serious and thoughtful stance adopted by parliament in accordance with the treaty .
( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , it will not have escaped anyone in this chamber and in the economic and productive world of the european union that an increase in aid for trade may help develop the market in a freer and at the same time fairer and better controlled way .
there are also problems there with the implementation of a market economy .
on the minimum age-limit my approach is to stick to the compromise minimum age-limit of 14 years which was agreed in previous negotiations , but to accept your amendment which makes it clear that fingerprinting must be carried out in compliance with the european convention on human rights and the united nations convention on the rights of the child .
no conflict can be solved through terrorism and violence .
but for procedural reasons we have had to present a package of amendments and these must reflect two fundamental issues .
. mr president , commissioner , mr president-in-office of the council , ladies and gentlemen , this year’s mobilisation of the flexibility instrument is closely connected with the success of the budget consultations and the agreement that we concluded – as we indeed needed to – between the institutions .
taken together , the unprecedented fiscal constraints on defence budgets , the many international crises and the united states ' strategic redeployment are significant factors that leave us no choice but to take our destiny into our own hands .
the idea , of course , is that the court should only prosecute if the country concerned does not do so itself .
that may be the solution for some , but unfortunately i think that they are going to be awfully disappointed .
i do not even believe that we need wait for further news tomorrow because , i reiterate , we have carried on for a year or more .
this runs counter to the principle of transparency and limits the role of parliament , which after all must perform a supervisory function .
mr president , last night dutch and american soldiers from the sfor arrested two croatians suspected of war crimes in the north of bosnia .
it is a common european problem that we are faced with bringing together fifteen different systems in ten different languages .
certain groups have expressed the view that there is no point investing in science if the necessary resources are lacking , and steps should be taken to prove this view wrong .
i hope that the council and the commission , together with the turkish government , make efforts towards implementing measures which allow the population of turkey to be involved in the democratisation process considerably more than has been the case so far , in order to ensure that there is fertile ground for implementing the reforms necessary for accession on the basis of the copenhagen criteria .
mr president , could i have an assurance that both commissioners are united in opposition to the import of beef produced with hormones and also milk produced with bst .
i do not know whether you can give me the floor now or whether you wish to give it to me after the decision on mr speroni 's proposal .
we have drawn attention to the sensitive fish processing industry , because both problems exist there .
do you think that we and the commission have done enough ?
let us hope that in addition to the amendments surrounding the legal basis , the commission will also approve the other amendments .
poverty and debt in developing countries affect exports .
hence you have the wynn report on supplementary and amending budget no 2 .
it is a good thing because , in many sectors , the use of mercury has been superseded and , indeed , has to be replaced by other materials , but a total ban on traditional objects , including the traditional mercury barometer , is taking matters too far in our view .
( ro ) certain countries in the euro area are currently facing severe financial problems , illustrated by the size of public debts and budget deficits , which are much higher than the threshold permitted by the stability and growth pact .
the bad news is that , more and more often , work goes undeclared .
corrections to votes and voting intentions : see minutes
the developing countries will also be among the losers , even though the doha round is meant to be a development round intended to reduce poverty and deprivation in developing countries .
i turn now to a number of specific questions raised .
amendment no 19 and parts of amendment no 23 are aimed at increasing the involvement of ngos in civil protection , which is something i naturally agree with , and so i also accept this in principle because it gives ngos the opportunity to participate in the exchange of expertise .
many such cuts would affect education .
in the light of the success of earlier campaigns on the euro , the results of these are still to be established .
if we look at the problems which the country is still trying to overcome , it is a reasonable assumption that they will result in massive immigration to the eu , which is why i have voted against the motion for a resolution .
did anyone else not hear the english interpretation ?
secondly , because they remove the reference to the commission 's white and green papers , and those provide the basis for the approach explaining the connection between the needs of the labour market and society in general .
the spanish initiatives , which we welcome here , concerning the sis’s new functions , in particular in the fight against terrorism , already provided for integrating these data in the sis , but have yet to be adopted due to a parliamentary reserve by denmark .
the ? u 's ambition , using blackmail and funding as a lever , is to incorporate its terms for building parties into its reactionary policies and so impose them .
a year ago , we witnessed in haiti one of the worst natural catastrophes in recent history , but this also triggered one of the best displays of solidarity , with people whose resilience in the face of disaster and disorder is a lesson of courage to us all .
we should not therefore envisage first of all restructuring processes with cockerill-sambre , and then with usinor .
finally , the role of small and medium-sized enterprises in this area must be clearly and officially recognised , given that it is these enterprises that produce the high quality goods and create the jobs .
i agree that we should never forget the chernobyl disaster .
innovation encourages the creation of synergies between traditional areas of activity and more innovative ones .
it is particularly painful and tragic that children are at particularly high risk of poverty in our prosperous society , and let me just say that i was therefore particularly outraged by mr buttiglione’s discriminatory remarks about mothers who bring up children on their own .
as far as i can tell , of the 14 projects accepted at the essen council , only the link between denmark and sweden ( oresund ) has been finished and the milan-malpensa airport is currently being completed , but without the rail shuttle and the rapid road link required by the commission , the eib and the european parliament .
they come all the same and work either on the black market or making themselves out to be self-employed .
the white paper emphasises the need to respect the autonomy and specificity of sport .
i know that the situation in europe is very complex , but slovakia is definitely not a country that you are in any position to criticise .
last february the food and agriculture organisation of the united nations warned that nearly 4 million people in southern africa would need emergency food assistance this year .
but that does not diminish the importance of fighting counterfeiting .
mrs lucas wants to do something about this and asks the eu to support countries which adopt strategies to protect their tropical forests .
the provisional ban on all feeds derived from animal products for animals intended for human consumption , as ordered by the council in december 2000 , was necessary , but the problem of by-products of animal origin must be addressed .
the amendment was rejected by almost 250 votes to 350 .
thank you very much .
even so , it certainly plays a vital part in spreading social , economic and environmental welfare , especially in those areas of our europe where not just the landscape but also the socioeconomic and demographic fabric is vulnerable .
in west kalimantan , the riots broke out as early as 1997 and 1999 and , across the country , these are , in actual fact , the result of the imposed transmigration programme of 1960 .
i would like to thank him most sincerely for his effective contribution to lifting the dossier out of the rut into which it had sunk .
as the member who has just spoken has said , we are undergoing a universal process of globalisation .
i am opposed to undifferentiated uniformity and bureaucratic centralism .
this therefore creates a genuine problem in terms of land-use planning .
this is an extremely useful remedy for the citizens , businesses and other organisations throughout europe , confronted as they are with cases of maladministration within the european institutions .
we have every reason to believe that russian interests have been implicated in the prestige accident .
next , with regard to the intergovernmental conference , which is the preliminary step we have to take in preparing our shared community for enlargement , i believe that we are moving forward significantly , but i am extremely aware that the council systematically tries to undervalue what it does .
the question is concerned with intellectual property rights and access to medicines .
furthermore , the proposals in the report are , for the most part , worthy of interest .
if that becomes the occasion for mob violence against italian citizens , i would submit that it would set back eu-turkey relations a long way .
one word that has , of course , come up time and again in the political talks on asylum and migration issues in recent years has been solidarity .
we have witnessed a european council , where the dispersal of the institutions , the dispersal of the council , split up into asides , factions and the most diverse formations , had a detrimental effect on the work of the belgian presidency , which did nothing to cause this of course . now we are reiterating the great principles and calmly and dispassionately saying how europe should be run , and where it is failing , because we are not applying the wise recommendations and thoughts of mr poos , which are also enhanced by his years of experience , of someone who has an insider ' s view of the council of ministers , and of the european council full stop .
simplification has been achieved , in particular , by the introduction of direct court-to-court transmission , although sometimes the requests go to the central bodies , and by the introduction of standard forms .
i would go further and say that they are not just interesting ; they are perhaps crucial to our union’s collective future .
the biggest political question remains the relationship between human solidarity and the division of financial burdens : the eu is called upon to offer effective support to states most affected by migratory flows and by a high number of asylum seekers , and which face specific and often disproportionate pressures due to their relatively small size .
quite clearly , as regards these accession partnerships we want to give out a clear signal again today . our will to enlarge the european union towards the east , including cyprus of course , remains unbroken !
it is essential that we consider such strategies in light of the specific requirements among the various member states .
i have not heard anything about an opt-out clause in this field .
the directive on the liberalization of the internal market in electricity does prescribe an obligatory licence , but this will remain a blunt instrument until it is supplemented by a supply and indemnification obligation .
this whole area is evolving very rapidly and with the development of the internet , simple commodities like names , text , strings and characters have become very valuable .
thirdly , there is an obvious need for check and balance mechanisms .
it is intolerable that the eu should involve itself in the formation of the government in a member state .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 9.00 a.m .
the directives under debate today refer to the free movement and residence of students as well as people who have ceased professional activity or who are economically inactive and who , furthermore , receive disability or old-age pensions or subsidies - all of them community citizens - as well as the exceptions laid down in another directive on expulsion for reasons of public order , security or public health .
and who sits in the council ?
it is vital for our prospects of bringing the world ever closer in terms of these minimum core standards - which include an end to slavery and child labour - that we start this round properly .
in addition to democracy and the rule of law , respect for human rights is what we require of candidate countries , and we also emphasise the affirmation of universal , inalienable rights in our international relations .
that brings me to the question of self-regulation , another new buzz word .
any of us who have had the experience of trying to dial a long international telephone number will remember that by the time you get near to the end , which is the time you almost always make a mistake , you have almost forgotten who you are ringing and why .
the regulation has been supported by many eu citizens , who are sensitive to the issue of animal welfare .
experience with development shows that if conditionality is imposed it is never effective .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i think it is a shame that mrs harms is no longer present .
in this context , i have to say that my country , galicia , is one of the major victims : in community waters ; we suffer ( ... ) at the hands of certain countries and fleets , in international waters , we suffer from the contempt of the commission and the council as a result of this international policy .
secondly , mrs thors and mr junker referred to production methods .
following this , the injured opposition members were able to fly to south africa .
unfortunately , the text stipulates that the manufacturer will be wholly or mainly responsible .
the changes to financial market regulation and market supervision represent a whole chapter in the effort to combat the current financial and economic crisis .
therefore we support the commission in its negotiations and also regret of course that the european parliament is not yet formally involved in the definition of negotiating mandates .
i am deeply convinced that the european parliament will not remain inactive on this issue .
i am not quite sure what democratic responsibility for economically efficient social development as a model for running an economy entirely means .
it is of course expected that the member states will have differing points of view on this issue as well .
it was a question of introducing general provisions applicable to all authorisation applications , as you yourself said , commissioner .
i will permit them , because the rules of procedure say that i should do so .
the gsp should be stable , predictable , objective , simple , transparent and compatible with the wto , and it must take account of the developing countries’ specific needs .
i have little sympathy for the way the commission is pushing this idea , even though it is well known that the council will not take it up under any circumstances .
you will be aware that this was an area in which the national reform programmes produced rather disappointing results , for they would , on average , have brought us up to 2.2 % by 2010 instead of the desired 3 % .
this report sets out the challenges ahead , as well as policy orientations for the future , in particular in relation to a new enlarged europe .
we do , however , have a good opportunity to improve the draft by means of amendments .
as a uk farmer , i will rely on veterinary recommendation and not the opinion of bureaucrats in other countries .
however , i should like to draw the house 's attention to a number of points which i believe to be very important .
i would like to hear the council’s approach on this .
i should like to draw your special attention to a few points .
it was silent on the unacceptable , wait-and-see and follow-my-leader attitude of the eu , which still continues to make the re-establishment of relations with the palestinian authorities , including the recommencement of financial support , dependent on their meeting certain conditions such as the 'commitment to non-violence ' , when it is israel that is occupying palestinian territories militarily ; or the 'recognition of israel ' , when it is israel that does not recognise the right of the palestinian people to its sovereign and independent state ; and 'respect for previous agreements and obligations , including the road map ' , when it is israel that does not comply with the united nations resolutions , the oslo accords and the road map itself and is continuing with its construction of the illegal wall and the policy of settlements .
resources would be better spent enforcing the directive in those member states which are non compliant .
there is no point in trying to guess today what the igc is likely to decide .
it was a mainly technical proposal and it was one that only contained benefits for businesses .
within the european union , it will be necessary for us to develop an anti-terrorist policy in harmony with the united states .
regarding the core issue of defending human rights , we are in agreement .
i have no problem doing that .
it makes it clear that agriculture has been used as a bargaining chip for other interests in negotiations conducted in the world trade organisation , not least , the interests of the european union 's large industrial and services groups .
i agree on the role of civil society and the importance of setting long-term targets , and transparency and public accountability are essential in this context .
the free trade agreement is one of the central elements of the broader association agreement we are negotiating with ukraine in the context of the neighbourhood policy .
my time has run out but i fear that your time is running out for credibility and decency .
however , the seat of parliament - of this chamber - is strasbourg , and it must remain so .
what i find extraordinary is that eur 2 billion are being managed by this vestige - the last remainder of the european coal and steel community , which , of course , was very important historically but is not important any more .
firstly , the fact that the rules on exchanges of information , which have been in place since the beginning of this parliamentary term , have not been implemented .
i also support the proposal to improve the user-friendliness of the grant application process .
mr president , the claims made by mr podestà and mr fiori seem to me to be totally unfounded .
i believe that the most essential thing , as mrs nicolai also mentioned , is that this is a decision made by serbia of its own will ; that serbia is committed to the european union and eu membership , and we will help this process by all possible means .
unfortunately , the european parliament meets none of these criteria , a fact that is not altered by the proposed amendments to the rules of procedure .
these response and preparedness actions are currently covered by various financing instruments , such as the action programme or the community civil protection mechanism .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , it is an honour for me to be here today , to inform parliament of the results of the council meeting on the budget , which took place on 17 july in brussels .
the rapporteur mentioned one critical question , that of comparative assessment .
it is a disgrace to us in the developed world .
they are leaving brussels for west flanders after their meetings this afternoon , where they will attend a number of events tomorrow commemorating the 90th anniversary of the battle of passchendaele .
i can assure you that , in terms of what is an ongoing dialogue with president borrell , there is no intention whatsoever of diminishing the capacity of ministers to be answerable and to answer questions directly to members in the format that we are presently enjoying .
we are asking member states to pledge their commitment to the encouragement of renewable energy - and they all say , individually , that they have this commitment - by signing a charter on renewable energy - the eurenew charter .
connections with the hinterland in the form of rail , internal waterways and road are essential in this respect .
we are asking for something very simple : a mechanism that will enable a warship from any community country in international waters to provide assistance to community vessels , whether fishing or merchant vessels .
.
podestà report ( a4-0405/96 )
the commission continues to support the best available options for improving the situation .
i propose that the european union become the bank 's partner , since this would create a better synergy between the union and this instrument , which is absolutely crucial to the future of our europe .
this issue is very dear to our hearts .
depending on how our work goes , we will see whether we are more or less productive .
the problem is that the answer to the drought disaster in afghanistan would be systematic , normal , broader-based development cooperation .
unsatisfactory coordination of aid and a plethora of programmes have led to a drop in aid effectiveness .
in any event , in the 2001 update of the stability programme , which is due to be presented by the end of the year , the greek authorities will undertake the necessary adjustment of their medium-term macroeconomic outlook and an assessment of the impact of this on public finances .
we want open doors , not more walls .
the group of independents for a europe of nations supported mr liese 's report .
i want to be clear on this .
the qualified majority still stands , but unanimity is now required in the case of full suspension of the application of the convention .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m .
the committee on fisheries reminds the commission of its concern regarding guarantees of product origin .
mr president , while taking the commissioner’s goodwill as read , i can not refrain from quoting to him a few figures on air pollution : 370 000 premature deaths per annum in europe , which is many times the number killed on the roads .
i would add that passengers must not be treated as a necessary evil whenever such situations arise , which unfortunately is what happens at present .
development assistance is a crucial link to preventing humanitarian emergencies .
who would elect the president of the union ?
the gold plated remuneration and bonuses of managers will be limited and will not be able to be cashed in full immediately .
in today 's newspaper an austrian agronomist says that small plant-breeding businesses could actually shed jobs because larger enterprises will compete them out of existence .
offenders should not imagine themselves to be safe in some law-free zone .
the mobilization of non-governmental organizations has translated the international law commission 's draft statute for a court to street level , and it has been converted into an unavoidable demand .
president-in-office of the council . - ( de ) mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , may i once again express my special thanks to the rapporteur but also to all of you for the debate and your contributions , which have certainly underlined how important it was to launch the barcelona process more than ten years ago and to formulate a policy for that purpose .
the world economy requires skills , flexibility , availability and knowledge of languages .
these are grave implications for the future of humanity , and they can not be shrugged aside , as our rapporteur seeks to do .
in order to obtain effective data protection , more than effective supervision is required .
therefore , in order to stave off this threat , the committee on agriculture and rural development voted in favour of an amendment that excludes the possibility of extending the wine-growing zone to include any member state other than those set out in the amendment .
commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to take this opportunity to share some concerns that are worthy of further reflection .
on these issues we also need a clear communication from the commission , and mainly from baroness ashton , on what is happening in these countries , expressing our support for the masses in those countries .
regarding monetary developments , we saw a high demand for liquid and safe assets in the autumn of last year , particularly associated with financial market uncertainty following the terrorist attacks .
ultimately , the european union must send a clear message to the president that the transition to civilian rule through free and fair elections is ...
let me also convey to her my sincere thanks for the work that the french presidency has been doing in the interests of sport and for the solidarity it has demonstrated with the commission and with parliament .
that is far from being the case .
it really is in this context that the report should be seen .
although the mission is being conducted more than adequately , we are receiving various signals that necessary materiel is sometimes being supplied too late or not at all .
until or unless another referendum is passed , this remains the legal position .
i believe in the ability of this programme to create the conditions necessary for successful competition with the new technology markets of china and the us , as well as maintaining european leadership in the telecommunications industry .
let us not forget that , first and foremost , our most important role as members of the european parliament is as public representatives of the people .
the fact that workers ' achievements as regards organisation and working time , improved health and safety conditions in the workplace and progress on work breaks and holidays , proper wages and secure jobs have been enshrined in law has also been very important .
it is true that in albania , compared with a year ago when there was a kind of civil war , there is now a parliament and a government and constant efforts are being made to put things back in their places . it is true that the situation has improved , but if the government and the opposition do not soon work together to cooperate and complete the new constitution in the parliament and if there is no cooperation within the parliament itself , then conflicts will emerge outside parliament , throughout the country , and the arms used will not be those of deliberation and democracy .
( sv ) mr president , it is gratifying that the european parliament 's legal service has established that it is wrong to use the non-ratified eu constitution as a reference in this report .
therefore it had nothing to do with mr le pen 's mandate as a member of the european parliament .
mr president , i would simply like to say thank you for the debate .
– the oral question ( o-0015/2006 – b6-0226/2006 ) to the commission on small arms by mr brok and mr von wogau , on behalf of the committee on foreign affairs .
the reasons are self-explanatory .
it is a vibrant symbol of the eu ' s political commitment to the new post-apartheid south africa .
despite maintaining a high public-sector deficit , the hungarian economy is characterised by one of the highest rates of growth in europe , by the lowest inflation recorded over the ten previous years and by a relatively low rate of unemployment .
we seem to be able to get weapons there for the eritreans and ethiopians to continue the war of aggression against each other over nonsensical issues and , at the same time , while the european union and the western world export weapons to ethiopia and to eritrea , the famine continues and the lives of millions and millions of people are threatened .
mr bushill-matthews has prepared a much-needed report .
but category 5 is the big area .
by setting high standards for europe 's potential 500 million customers , we shall also be setting global standards for the world to follow .
the legal and administrative capacity to form a fully viable society based on the rule of law has been strengthened , but more is still required .
i want to express particular concern about the youth programme .
mr posselt is quite right there .
there is still a lot of lost ground to be made up where fuels and materials are concerned , and this programme should provide an opportunity for that to be done , but we must also - as my colleague has already mentioned - give very serious attention to the environment , and i attach particular importance to this .
( fr ) mr president , i should like to invoke the rules of procedure .
on 13 march 1997 the european parliament adopted its guidelines for the 1998 budget procedure .
my appeal would not be to leave this also to the resourcefulness of the national finance ministers individually , but , in fact , to find out whether we can not extract common standards from the lisbon objectives , the broad economic guidelines , and hopefully soon also the opinion of wim kok’s high-level group .
we are well aware that the new financial regulation that we adopted in this house , does not permit operating grants , but a solution must nevertheless be found to this grave problem so that the info-points affected can continue to work through 2004 and can continue to inform the public about the activities of the european union and the work that we do on a daily basis .
suspicions that the egyptian authorities turned a blind eye to or even encouraged religious violence should be dispersed by a firm undertaking that the christian community will be safe in egypt .
we feel there is still a lot of clearing-up to be done and that questions should be asked as to why the information was withheld or was misleading , and why the irregular practices were tolerated for years , due perhaps , as mr kellett-bowman said , to an excess of loyalty .
in march 2006 , palestinian and israeli representatives participated constructively in the meeting of senior euromed officials and the euromed committee , despite the disputes resulting from the outcome of the elections in the palestinian territories .
so less land for food equals less food but an increase in the supply of people , which inevitably means an increase in food prices .
to be more precise , this report is about the direction parliament wishes to go in .
in this agricultural debate , which differs from previous agricultural debates , i would ask you , commissioner , to intervene in these two areas of cereals and pigmeat and , as you did in the case of beef , to use all possible means to relieve the market .
that is why mr van rompuy 's first decision , namely to convene a european council dedicated to the economy and to climate change and now also , of course , to the haiti strategy - you spoke about this issue and it is one on which i believe that europe has to show both its heart and its know-how and you must intervene to ensure that the council has a greater presence in haiti - is , in my view , a positive position .
i have therefore voted against the present report , as this is not a matter that the european parliament should involve itself in .
an objective is set , but neither the resources nor the sanctions to achieve these objectives are created .
this week my party marks the 25th anniversary of the election of margaret thatcher as prime minister of the united kingdom , whose government i was privileged to join .
we also maintain regular contacts with the representatives of belarusian civic society and we intend to continue this dialogue as well as our support to civic society and the independent media in belarus .
in writing . - we have adopted with a big majority the compromise package reflecting the green position , to which our group has substantially contributed .
( cs ) i welcome the submission of the green paper on the reform of the common fisheries policy .
a new commission study has confirmed what is already well-known among specialists : there is over-capacity in europe 's refineries , and this is a structural problem .
therefore , i would make the following appeal : do not hide behind ireland , take a step forward , ratify the treaty of lisbon before europe day 2009 , before the end of your council presidency .
we need to develop democratic citizenship and participation .
written statements ( rule 142 )
as usually happens , it took the presidency of a small state to demonstrate the necessary intelligence and pro-european approach to attempt to solve such a significant problem .
it would therefore seem that , once again , the commission has , when all is said and done , made do with issuing a statement which , when applied in operational terms , is not really a solution at all .
where is our opinion on the reunions and actions of former members of ss units in eu countries ?
it is for us to demonstrate that free trade can take place in a developmental context and to reconcile mutual interests with solidarity .
here , 82 % of the dutch members voted .
in the short term , as others have said , we need to rescue the gains made at hong kong : the landmark agreement to end export subsidies by 2013 ; duty- and quota-free access for the poorest countries , modelled on the eu’s pioneering ‘everything but arms’ scheme ; as well as a substantial commitment to expanding aid for trade to improve supply-side capacity and trade-related infrastructures in the ldcs .
not long ago , we voted in a resolution whose aim was to reinforce mechanisms of surveillance over co2 and other gases .
in this case , we must see which systems have succeeded , so that we can exchange experience and procedures , as in the case of spain , to which mrs sornosa martínez has referred .
we have of course worked very hard on this report in our committee on citizens ' freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs .
one of the things we really strengthened in the seventh framework programme was precisely international cooperation .
secondly , we can compile a guide containing this information on all new models , which also includes a top ten of the most economical and environmentally-friendly cars .
finally , i urge the commission to ensure that there is strict compliance with the fifth research framework programme ' s call for no support to be provided for any form of human cloning .
just how difficult the situation is , you can see from two remarks made in the last three minutes .
it is an extremely fragile opportunity that the extremists want to shatter .
i am also pleased that the union has committed itself to sending a long-term observation mission to monitor the elections taking place this november , thus ensuring that every mauritanian citizen can exercise his or her voting rights .
that has been the opinion expressed by this house in past years .
we need to make it compulsory to compile gender-differentiated statistics on both wage levels and the gender balance in the individual sectors .
madam president , when we came in this morning there was a distinct smell of cigars in this chamber .
it will most definitely have been noticed in minsk and in other countries that russia considers as its sphere of influence .
( pt ) my thanks go to my colleague , pasqualina napoletano , for her excellent report .
i can assure you that the luxembourg presidency attaches the greatest importance to this issue .
this house has done away with discrimination against older workers and enabled them to have the same opportunities for continued employment as their younger colleagues ; it has caused the same weight to be given to the principle of gender mainstreaming as it receives in the european social fund , and - crucially - this fund has been enabled to make microloans enabling workers to acquire the capital they need if they are facing unemployment and want to become self-employed for lack of any alternative - and that is precisely the point : they have no alternative , because europe 's trade policy has been wrongheaded from the word go .
that is a long time ago .
hence the need to ensure that we have statistics that give us a true picture of the situation and which can provide a basis for the creation of action programmes and the drafting of evaluation reports ;
approximately 50 % of the world 's shipping tonnage carries non-toxic substances as bulk goods .
in the commission 's clarification yesterday , he speaks about 'all past analyses will have to be done again under a new perspective , and the commission will have to examine each case on a case-by-case basis ' .
is it not about time that we stopped expressing sympathy and started issuing enforcement notices to get rid of these ships of shame in favour of safe seas or we will be back again , later on this year , discussing a new motion for a resolution when yet another flag-of-convenience tanker sadly goes down spewing its crude oil all over the sea .
that , i should stress , is being operated on a voluntary basis .
projects should also continue to be defined by considering the long-term perspective and in-depth development of a safety culture in the nuclear industry of the concerned countries .
the strict pollution reduction targets , as proposed for particulate matter , can only be achieved in that way .
who will pay for this ?
not one of the resolutions adopted by parliament provides for the creation of maps identifying the areas at risk of fire which must be taken into account in terms of planning and development .
we shall be deepening and supporting an amendment from the socialists , amendment no 4 on paragraph 8 .
we hope that all these impressions , qualities and images of piet dankert will be of comfort to his wife , paulette , and his children .
companies ' competitiveness and dynamism depend directly on a regulating climate which is conducive to investment , innovation and entrepreneurship .
thank you , mr mann .
these are all issues which can not be dealt with appropriately under the heading of other priorities . the latter are more specific and come under what could be described as more clearly targeted research programmes .
nearly a year has passed since the commission published its communication on the mid-term review of the sixth community environment action programme .
if my information is correct , there has long been a commission proposal before the council aimed at encouraging the use of these biodiesels by reducing the tax on them .
the commission may argue that , indirectly , if we provide data to the americans , the australians and to south korea , for example , we will benefit from it in terms of security .
that is why i was hurt to see european farmers spreading milk all over the fields in a situation where we are facing starvation problems globally .
they are not the same and therefore should not be voted as identical amendments .
last night my report was called and i was not here .
author . - mr president , once again , we are forced to speak about human rights in iran , after nasrin sotoudeh was sentenced to 11 years in jail .
very well , i believe that the assembly has been put in the picture ; the arguments have been put forward .
in writing . - ( de ) the european globalisation adjustment fund was established to protect workers who have been made redundant as a result of the global financial and economic crisis .
it is clear that we have a stability pact , but there is also a growth pact , and the key word for our economies in the near future is growth .
the council 's position on the working time directive blatantly contradicts the intentions of achieving a balance between work and private life .
four direct victims of that attack are with us today in the gallery , mr president . jesús ramírez castanedo , who was seriously wounded in the attack ; jesús abril escusa , who lost his 19-year-old son ; isabel casanova ortega , who lost her 22-year-old son together with her father ; and euclides antonio río grajales , who was seriously wounded in the attack .
let me therefore re-emphasise that , compared with other regions of the world , we invest too little in research and development and in education and training , and even in the realm of infrastructural investments , which this house has so often commended and demanded , we are still lagging behind .
we need to continue to maintain sanctions but , at the same time as maintaining sanctions , we need to provide humanitarian aid .
we have to be aware today that either we offer countries on our eastern borders the prospect of membership or our appeals for democracy , market economy and respect for human rights will remain empty words .
firstly , restoring funding for humanitarian aid in kosovo to an adequate level , and also making p.m. entries for turkey , the socrates , leonardo and youth for europe programmes , and the exceptional financial assistance for azerbaijan .
once the regulation enters into force , therefore , the authority will have powers concerning the registration and direct supervision of credit rating agencies .
unfortunately , however , there is still a very long way to go as regards its implementation .
it has also highlighted conflicting interests between manufacturers , on the one hand , and suppliers and consumers , on the other .
representatives of all the political groups were involved .
so we welcome the fact that the commission is presenting a communication and putting forward proposals .
the fresh proposal by mr watson is an improvement , but not yet sufficient to prevent accidents .
in our opinion , both strategies underline the fact that economic , social and environmental goals can strengthen each other and should therefore be designed , developed and promoted together .
can the commission provide an evaluation of the likelihood of a successful conclusion of the doha development round by the end of next year ?
the very complex system currently in force for registering patents , which is time-consuming and expensive in comparison to the american system , is no help whatsoever to european entrepreneurs .
north korea is slowly starting to open up .
there is evidence that several of these flights were carrying prisoners from the incirlik base in turkey to guantanamo , including the 'bosnian six ' .
the council has committed itself to a full community involvement in this initiative .
the next item is the report ( a5-0009/2003 ) by mr santini , on behalf of the committee on citizens ' freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs , on the proposal for a european parliament and council directive on the right of citizens of the union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the member states [ com ( 2001 ) 257 - c5-0336/2001 - 2001/0111 ( cod ) ] .
i have mentioned two important initiatives in this field in my annual report .
the rapporteur and all of us are bound by our common values and principles , in particular the thessaloniki agreement for the countries of south-east europe which arose from the desire to permanently root out the sources of conflict in this part of europe .
i might add that that is also the reason why we , in the conference of presidents , initially delayed adopting a resolution on the follow-up administrative agreements , since these , of course , have to be renegotiated , not least in the light of the resolutions that we will be adopting on these four reports in may of this year .
to this purpose , they reaffirmed that the right balance needs to be struck between public and private responsibilities and formal and informal care , and that provision in a residential or community setting is to be preferred to an institutional setting .
we are travelling very fast down the line of repression while , on the other lines , such as guaranteeing the right of asylum and the right to a defence , the european parliament , the european union , the european commission and the council are incapable of making progress .
this accords excellently with the values that the charter of fundamental rights represents .
furthermore , we managed to reduce the exception which the council wanted for peak-load power stations , with the result that the polluting emission can be curtailed in this respect too .
i personally would have preferred a recommendation , although there were good reasons for the decision to opt for a framework directive .
production and the characteristics of the supply chain do not stop at the borders of the 25 member states of the european union .
so in any event , the number of signatures is above the minimum required for the vote on the motion of censure .
i am , of course , thinking of the 'milk fund ' .
the unprecedented crisis in the financial system is the result of the deep economic crisis in the capitalist system and the clash of interests and acute competition between monopolies .
once again , it is not politicians but the timorese themselves , with their cries and their pain who have drawn attention to their just cause .
i also wonder about the wisdom of the eu and its reaction to the formation of the government in austria and how that is going to affect public opinion there .
if europe is moving closer to an ever more effective unity , what point can there be in fragmenting both languages , which in actual fact are spoken across borders and other divisions ?
the commission’s original communication envisaged eur 6.1 billion per year for the project .
mr president , i voted for mrs buitenweg ' s report on the budget , but i should like to stress very strongly and loudly here in parliament , with so many members present on this occasion , that the pensioners ' party - which i have the honour to represent in this house - believes that the european parliament , which now legislates on fifty per cent of all national laws , which are adaptations to the directives that we approve here , should have greater funding and better organisation in order to function as befits a supranational parliament , a parliament with so many important duties .
in this crisis , precarious workers were the first to be affected by job losses .
we need an industrial policy , all of whose components work towards the same goal : constructing a strategy that is based on sustainable , employment-centred growth that is built around the optimisation of skills and which shows that social and technological innovations are compatible with each other .
this report by amnesty international contains a number of interesting proposals which warrant closer examination .
i must confess that this debate strikes me as rather odd , since the impression is surely being created that our european officials , however competent they may be and however hard they work , constitute a rather pathetic category that needs support on a number of levels .
we must close dangerous reactors - not just chernobyl , but elsewhere also - and we must resolve ways in which to find the funding to do so .
the european parliament is in a position to monitor the level of progress , particularly where local and regional financing are concerned .
a revised transport regulation , which reinforces the provisions to be applied in this field , was adopted in september 1996 .
it is evident that the esf has to adapt itself again , because circumstances have changed .
ladies and gentlemen , i am afraid we are wasting time .
france pursues a very independent policy where the french language is concerned .
we needed provisions of this kind to set out standard regulations at community level for punishing employers as , in the majority of cases , a steady stream of people is supplied by transnational human trafficking networks .
( it ) madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i am favourably disposed towards this resolution in that it assists the democratic life of europe .
and the systematic doping that this commercialisation encourages is simply intensifying this process.those are the facts of the matter .
the european union is the world 's largest importer of agricultural produce , but i also welcome the encouragement given to internal production with minimal impact on climate change .
ever since early last winter , when we began work on the 2003 budget , my objective , as rapporteur and as a person responsible for next year 's budgets for eight of the eu institutions , has at any rate been to find a solution in which the eu 's administrative budget is balanced and in which we do not have to ask for extra money by making use of what is known as the flexibility instrument .
if island youth is not tempted to stay at home , not only will unique island cultures disappear but valuable cultural heritages will be lost .
b5-0153/2003 , by mr queiró and mr ribeiro e castro , on behalf of the uen group , on the situation in venezuela .
have you forgotten the unanimous agreement on radical reform of the cap that you personally endorsed and your government signed up to only 18 months ago ?
we are discussing how general motors in the us staggered on for months .
thus , in many cases , this sme will not be able to set off any start-up losses against profits which it may continue to generate in its member state of residence .
the june european council is likely to initiate an assessment of the achievements of the tampere programme , with a view to launching a further development of the union’s justice and home affairs policies .
mr president , one minute and thirty seconds is much more than i need , given that the vast subjects dealt with in this portmanteau report presuppose the existence of a minister for foreign affairs , a diplomatic service and a common foreign policy .
indeed , it proposes to extend the aid provided during the actual legal proceedings to the pre-litigation stage too , given that effective mediation , an attempt to achieve reconciliation between the parties can often even obviate the need for actual legal proceedings , reducing , therefore , or eliminating all the inconvenience for the citizens concerned and , most importantly , reducing the costs involved .
i would refer the commissioner and the house to mr belleré 's opinion and in particular paragraphs 8 and 9 in which we call for free and fair competition between transport modes with all modes of transport fully bearing their own costs including external costs and where we call for free and fair competition to be encouraged between the community ports and between maritime shipping lines .
the legislation currently in force at eu level is inadequate in the face of such challenges , for example when it comes to safeguarding the mental and moral development of the youngest media consumers .
thanks to the socialist group 's amendments , a more constructive language for the dialogue on russia and iran has been achieved .
the second concerns , for example , the work programme for environmental strategy ...
erasmus mundus is a newer programme for student mobility and academic cooperation .
this additional guarantee makes it possible for the eib to continue with its investment policy , which is of great benefit to the world economy .
there has been no democracy , and what they call democracy today operates like this : parties are declared to be democratic and selected to take part in the elections , while the algerian people are not allowed to present the parties of their choice .
i therefore think it is appropriate that the european union should continue its actions of supporting the economies of third world countries and poor countries , because i am convinced that only by improving the living standards of the citizens of our world who live in poverty - or rather in extreme poverty , not just in poverty , but in the most wretched poverty there could be - will we succeed in preventing conflicts of any kind .
in any event , the final decision in this respect is the responsibility of the member states .
fundamental rights are indivisible , but the obligations of the state are different : for traditional minorities , we need to guarantee that their identity and language are protected ; for migrant minorities , we need to guarantee that they are integrated into society .
i am therefore particularly pleased that the council and parliament , in their common position on the erasmus mundus programme , are asking special attention for the promotion of the knowledge of languages of students both within and outside of the european union .
the proposal also ignored the proportion of events due to failures within the monopoly providers such as atc and airports , and the inability of airlines to obtain compensation from them .
what we need now , commissioner , is for the presidency and the commission to speed up their work on finding a definitive solution for the nut sector in the european union within the framework of the com in fruit and vegetables and , until then , to extend the improvement plans .
the principle says that if the product is accepted somewhere in europe , it can not be denied access to another member state unless the authorities can provide evidence that the application of a national technical rule is justified .
even if i do not agree with all the proposed solutions , in particular i welcome the commitment to a comprehensive review of the single market .
enlargement makes action on all these fronts all the more urgent and every single citizen must be involved in making the changes happen .
we are in favour of a breach in social tradition in our ports .
that is why the social partners have a vital role to play when the goal is to strengthen european competitiveness .
i am very glad that following the customary practices of the european parliament , i need not have worried because the debate got going at about 10.30 p.m .
my vote reflects this view .
the commission declared 2010 european year for combating poverty and social exclusion .
that is why investment in culture helps to increase our potential , strengthens european identity and makes europeans more attractive .
these very innovative approaches provide a good opportunity to improve governance .
as the french presidency gets underway , it must be noted - and as a french mep this is not something i am terribly proud of - that france has taken a long time to transpose several european directives into its national law .
however , i do not think the agreement in question is on the right lines , since it does not help the countries concerned to create a self-sufficient economy able to sustain itself without depending on external aid .
mr president , the report by mr linkohr is really good and i am therefore very happy to congratulate him .
in my earlier answers i already explained just how very aware the commission is of this problem and how it is therefore prepared - and has shown great flexibility in this connection - to consider extensions , provided that a definite and specific date is given .
i shall now take the example of a small undertaking , also in relation to the concept of benchmarking . let us take the example of a man who wishes to set up a business .
i am not frightened of the institutional crisis , the financial perspective or the lisbon strategy in themselves , but i am afraid that all these elements together may be extremely damaging to the european union .
in this regard , i would like to express my satisfaction because the report highlights the constructive role of the commission in the examination of petitions and because it considers it to be satisfactory on the whole .
together with actions in the fight against counterfeiting , i would highlight the suggestion to take action to support traditional textiles with focused programmes , not least so that we can avoid further official approval of textile goods , which is certainly of little use in the context of celebrating regional identities .
issues such as the introduction of eco-taxes and taxes on particularly harmful substances such as chlorine , the rehabilitation of contaminated areas and the long-term usability of certain substances and products are still on the agenda as matters of urgency , even though parliament has not adopted a clear position on them in this report .
the swedish presidency wishes to promote cooperation in this area .
he has not done anything criminal whatsoever ; he has acted entirely in accordance with the law and the constitution .
thank you , mr president .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i support what mr wohlfart has said on behalf of the council , and i should simply like to add that if the european parliament would like to set in motion a mechanism for political dialogue at the parliamentary level , the commission would put itself at your disposal , because just at the moment , anything which can help to open new channels of dialogue with the representatives of the algerian people is interesting .
europe must support it - i fully agree with the previous speaker on this .
we would not have got to where we are in northern ireland without the help from the european parliament .
i would like to thank the rapporteurs and all members who are responsible for the fact that the european parliament has clearly expressed its uncompromising position with such a huge majority against the non-transparent negotiation of such an important international agreement .
further points must also be incorporated into the common position .
we need to make it quite clear that we are as concerned about the competitiveness of europe per se as we are about cultural diversity in europe , the cultural diversity that makes europe what it is and - and this too is an important point in this resolution - the potential of small and medium-sized enterprises .
i believe that the committee on budgets , in cooperation with the committees , is handling this twofold fight quite well .
mr president , commissioner , i wish to do as the commissioner did and note that his area is one of the most important for european consumers .
that is important but , in overhauling the white paper , we must also write more , and take more decisions , about alternative fuels and the renewal of our stock of vehicles .
individual terrorists are difficult to identify and here we are discussing privacy laws and whether or not to adopt technologically more advanced measures .
technical and empirical studies have failed to show that an overall reduction in employment taxation would increase employment .
i believe that the package adopted is expensive and pointless , and fallujah is its failure foretold .
all we see in it are reform proposals that are already very familiar , such as lifelong learning , support for research , completion of the market in financial services and the opening of the energy and transport markets , measures which will bear little fruit in the immediate future .
we had beef mountains , we had butter mountains , we had milk lakes and we had cereal mountains .
in any case , the european union has spared no efforts in this respect .
we also discussed the fiori report in very wide and detailed terms , and it was made very clear that we do not want any patenting of human genes .
on monday , the president told this parliament that the first world war , a war in which both of my grandfathers defended their country , was a civil war .
we saw an example of this only yesterday , with the canadian multinational , which is seeking to close many of its production units in countries such as germany , the united kingdom , sweden and portugal , and which , where my own country is concerned , is the only company engaged in producing rolling stock and train carriages .
bold community funding is more than needed in order to avoid all this .
secondly , any nationalist race is a concern for the commission and is an issue which needs to be treated very seriously within the framework of our relations with the country .
the scope of this programme clearly deserves this amount .
this is lower than the 2.8 % rate of inflation for the 27 eu member states .
unquestionably , therefore , there is a need to establish common priorities and ways of working together in order to respond effectively to the forthcoming changes .
with a view to taking advantage of existing structures rather than creating new ones , the commission is proposing to examine the means to be applied to improve co-ordination between all the networks that are already operational .
i believe that the european parliament should currently be sensitive to the fact , condemned by certain ngos , that four palestinians may be executed if yasser arafat does not commute the sentences handed down for internal activities within the palestinian area or for collaboration .
their development is therefore directly related to areas such as employment , social inclusion , environmental protection and the achievement in general of the cohesion policy objectives .
having been examined by the council , what was previously only a proposal for a directive has been split into two legal instruments , a proposal for a regulation and a proposal for a directive , and the members of the committee on transport and tourism felt that this was the right thing to do .
that is why i consider supporting amendment 48 which reintroduces the waste stabilisation target .
let me add immediately that this is not just the commission’s responsibility .
. mr president , commissioner , i should first of all like to thank our rapporteur , because i believe that we have here a good proposal for the position of parliament .
heavy lorries , therefore , have major implications for the health of our citizens .
as for the descent from the summit , i think it is important to choose the best route , since the same grade of climbing difficulty may be a much greater challenge on the way down than on the ascent .
as mrs theorin is certainly aware , the european union ' s preparatory conference , which was planned for december of this year within the framework of the european commission , will now take place in february of next year .
we are closely monitoring developments and preparing for different scenarios .
furthermore , all member states should support european union day , which is organised for 9 may , as this would greatly contribute to developing the rapport with the public that is severely lacking .
with regard to the southern neighbourhood , i shall make three points .
when the finnish minister for social affairs and health , tuula haatainen , addressed our committee in early october , she highlighted the mainstreaming of equality policies in budgetary planning and evoked the finnish example of seeking to ensure that all items , not only in the national , but also in the eu budget , take gender equality policies into account .
no : these are the basis of all the measures we will take this year .
perhaps in our own internal debate within the groups , we can see how to try to coordinate some positions and to what extent , if it is possible , we could advance or progress the sensitive questions on institutions .
it is imperative that the promotion of sustainable fisheries and the needs of fisheries-dependent communities are kept to the fore .
towards this end , we will continue our support to the iraqi refugees .
at this time when we are facing this severe economic and financial crisis , one of the principal consequences is an increase in unemployment .
indeed , interpretation of one offence - piracy - and its punishment will seemingly , in future , no longer be delegated to a judicial authority but to internet access providers .
it is a shame that the biggest political group in this house is no longer a reliable negotiating partner .
like commissioner patten , however , i should not like it to be forgotten that the eu delegation on the spot has already been doing beneficial work for years and has constantly intervened .
i support all those who are eager to work constructively together towards real peace for my homeland .
mr president , i am interested first and foremost in how relations with parliament actually stand ?
finally , i would like to thank mr vasco graça moura once again .
everyone here is in favour of granting asylum to the victims of political persecution .
just like the cube , it should bear the symbols , it should have a message and be a keystone and a foundation for our joint european building , but , at the same time , it is made up of 27 pieces .
korea is the eu 's fourth largest trade partner outside europe , whereas in 2006 the eu was the largest foreign investor in korea .
if the eu is to be based on democratic principles this has to be prevented .
the fight against one of the most repugnant of crimes , the trafficking and distribution of addictive drugs , must be intensified , and every step in the right direction is to be welcomed .
it seems to me less than prudent - and here i am referring to the speeches of some of my fellow members - to start thinking about extending the purpose and scope of the authority to include environmental issues and matters relating to traditional foods . these are issues to be dealt with by the market and the member states .
to this end , it is vital for parliament to draw up a new strategy , in addition to providing financial and human resources , in the form of a separate item of the eu budget .
as i was just saying , mr president , this morning i was drinking a coffee in the members ' bar on the third floor .
i understand that further research is being carried out , as a result of which it would probably not be wise to vote on it at 5 p.m. today .
this commission is confronted with a harsh legacy of bad management .
if a european network of national contact points is set up that takes into consideration the member states ' various internal criminal justice solutions , which have arisen out of their legal systems and traditions , it will enhance the exchange of information and the adoption of good practice without destroying the individuality of the national legal systems or creating artificial structures that clash with them .
we must harness the savings of the general public in europe in order to finance both sustainable transport networks and eco-efficiency .
credible evaluations of the draft legislation have been undertaken , and these have shown that there are special problems for small enterprises where 1-10 tonne volumes are concerned .
the council will continue to observe developments in equatorial guinea very closely and will take every opportunity to underline the importance it attaches to upholding human rights and democratic principles in that country .
greece therefore imposed the truce at that time .
clear criteria for recovery must therefore be developed .
mr president , most of the time , the european parliament , spearheaded by environment committees , does its very best to make a critical assessment of the proposals submitted by the european commission or the council , so as to improve on them from an environmental point of view .
in writing . - ( fr ) aids is the biggest epidemic in history , affecting all regions , all social sectors and all age groups .
according to a study by the european schoolnet , the development of interschool learning environments is flourishing in europe .
( the president cut off the speaker )
three conditions must be met : we must work to make trade more compatible with sustainable development and social welfare ; we must respect multilateral solidarity and commitments ; and we must guarantee real democratic control .
southern sudan should now be the eu 's number one humanitarian development priority .
surely the commission should be insisting that all member states should at least seek to do that .
that would be a very bad thing , especially for the people concerned .
secondly , i should like to raise an objection to the comparison of the council with the mafia .
it can not therefore be claimed that exports from the african countries in particular can be safeguarded if the descriptions for the consumer are very poor .
on the other hand , although he spoke about depleted uranium , he made absolutely no mention of the statement made by nato on 18 january , in which it was admitted that , in addition to depleted uranium , plutonium had also been used .
however , further delay would also mean a delay in starting programmes , which would be a bad thing for the regions and the poorer member states .
we need to remind the ugandan authorities of their obligations under international law and under the cotonou agreement .
the european parliament 's message in its report is a clear one .
i hereby declare the 2011-2012 session of the european parliament resumed .
there is no way out of this .
i shall of course be sending parliament 's condolences to the families concerned .
they work towards helping young people in existing and future member states learn to conceive democratic values as worthy of protection .
furthermore , i apologize profusely to the commissioner for the rumpus a moment or two ago , but we do not really know how to control the house when it is coming into session .
i wonder why , as a committed europhile , i find myself disagreeing in this debate with many other committed europhiles and specifically the rapporteurs .
this means that the eu should not devote itself to development policy and policy on tourism .
two chapters remain to be closed .
madam president , i should only like to comment on this point very briefly .
mr bertens ' reference to general lebed seems pertinent .
we must defend human dignity throughout the world .
that is the wrong direction to take .
it is clear , mr president , that this social and economic model is completely contrary to workers ' interests , and that is why we shall fight to overturn it .
this is not just a game of heads or tails , with either the immigrants winning or the locals winning , we all stand to gain from a reasonable , targeted immigration and integration policy if we would only just get on with it and put everything commissioner vitorino and the council have proposed into practice .
we should therefore take stock of the situation for the first time at the employment summit to be held during the portuguese presidency .
we take note of your remarks , mr bushill-matthews .
it is a very serious matter .
when are we going to turn our attention to the essentials ?
there are also certain policy areas that need to be developed further .
genetic modification of plants and seeds holds out the possibility of better food production in harsh climates and of assuring future food supplies to a fast-growing world population .
the citizens are not annoyed with the italian government .
the kosovan example should compel us more than ever to reaffirm the right of the peoples of europe to be themselves and to make their own decisions , in other words to preserve their identity and sovereignty , and in an enlarged european europe of nations and homelands there should also clearly be a legitimate place for the people of serbia .
it is a good thing that the commission is intending to earmark another eur 9.5 million for women and children over and above the 50 million already spent .
european culture is under siege from atlanticist values .
as far as exports are concerned , let us know how to open up our markets to the outside world and provide the means to promote communications on product quality in europe .
monnet realised early that , acting alone , 'the nations of europe are too circumscribed to give their people the prosperity made possible and hence necessary by modern conditions ' .
it has been said here , and president santer has frankly admitted , that in implementing these programmes we are often held up by our own red tape .
it is going to come from the profits of the car companies .
therefore , if the proposals suggested by the commission are brought forward , i believe it would have huge political consequences in areas like wales .
i reiterate the commitment and importance we attach to using the framework directive in the kind of ways that i outlined in my initial answer .
we want everyone to do that and we want that to happen now .
all of the fisheries policy which is based on the community buying fishing rights from the poor countries of africa is wrong .
it is raising the question of whether we want european suffrage .
how many lives could have been saved !
i have to say , as usual , that i have never heard so much nonsense talked in my life as i have today .
in view of these and many other effects and aware of the fact that we do not yet have a final figure for the material damage , which , of course , spain will provide through its request for assistance from the fund , we think that the european commission should help these regions return to normal . this would complement the immense public effort in the affected member states and would give priority to repairing the serious damage with the objective of restoring living conditions and economic stability in these areas as soon as possible .
with regard to your statement that decision making within the wto is the sole preserve of the richer nations , i would say that , although this may once have been true , it is increasingly less the case in an organisation of more than 140 members and , in which , small discussion groups are inevitable in its day-to-day work .
are there any objections ?
you are right , mr sainjon .
for all these reasons , and in the hope that , as mr cunha ' s report requests , the commission will inform this parliament of the result of the application of this protocol , our group , mr president , calls for the approval of the cunha report .
the report on social inclusion in the new member states highlights a wide range of new challenges .
– mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i warmly appreciated commissioner patten’s words , but it is with great disappointment and concern that i note that the text of the joint motion for a resolution on the situation in iraq that has been put before us is a serious step backwards compared with parliament’s condemnation of the united states’ pre-emptive war that was issued early in 2003 .
the fund also requires the operational programmes to contain information on how the partnership principle has been implemented , the list of the parties that have been consulted , the results of those consultations and how they have been taken into account .
let us take the tax issue head on .
safety should not come second to the pursuit of profit by companies which aim to take over eurocontrol ' s market .
i believe that we must remain very prudent when dealing with an issue such as this .
given the current climate , this debate is extremely timely .
the oostlander-barón crespo report , which the european parliament has just devoted to the enlargement strategy proposed by the commission in the agenda 2000 programme , is about a politically indispensable change , but a descent into a financial impasse at the same time .
mr president , for most europeans , the era of the euro will not actually begin until they are required to use euro coins and notes in the shops .
mrs berès , this is not a point of order .
in our experience , projects failed to get under way , or got under way only very slowly in past decades , due among other things to the reluctance of the community to assist with funding .
it is , however , no more than a supplement to local initiatives in the process of necessary innovative structural change .
i indicated a short while ago that i wished to put a supplementary question , and even though i did so very early on , it would appear that no one noticed .
that would be a helpful and useful side effect of this legislation .
this year , 2005 , will be decisive in terms of reform and the reinforcement of multilateralism , of international law , and , in particular , of the united nations .
mr president , i , too , would like to offer a warm welcome to the moroccan delegation with us today . i shall also endeavour to analyse two issues confronting us , namely the growth and stability pact and the informal ecofin council and shall attempt to report on both during my first speech .
i am pleading for professional realism as to how we evaluate these things .
in the resolution on macedonia 's progress in 2009 towards implementing the eu membership criteria , we drew attention to the fact that the country 's government should be more sensitive to matters of ethnic minorities and strive for greater media transparency .
however , in practice , the officers start to exercise power and find that they like it .
the multilingualism portfolio is not worthy of mr orban , nor does it make sufficient demands of a commissioner , and so i do not understand why he is being given such a thin portfolio .
draftsman of the opinion of the committee on the environment , public health and food safety . - ( de ) madam president , may i add my congratulations to the many that have already been expressed to the rapporteurs .
business wants to train people and is entitled to do that , that is all well and good .
like the rapporteur , whom i congratulate , i too should like to say once again how glad i am that - ten years after the last proposal foundered - there is at last a possibility of making progress in this field .
this will involve preparatory actions and pilot programmes for a limited time , even before a legal basis is proposed .
thank you for your attention .
in this context , investment in new technologies such as computerised 'stop-go ' in freight transport and support for modes of transport other than road transport play an important role and point the way ahead .
the commissioner is under a lot of pressure today and parliament has expressed a significant amount of concern .
businesses need clear criteria in order to comply with legislation and plan ahead .
we know the importance of that sector .
the commission has a role to play in this .
let us refrain from creating unnecessary obstacles between us .
less costs and less bureaucracy for the consumer who has a genuine case in order to seek redress .
mr president , the ecall system in motor vehicles is a major advance in assisting emergency services to get to the scene of an accident as quickly as possible .
what is important is that all imports should be controlled , that plans for emergencies should be kept up to date , and that the commission should actively involve itself in them without delay .
i want to mention the relationships , which have sometimes been difficult , between the commission and the parliament .
where colombia differs from other countries is in the fact that land there is still in the hands of local and regional landowners .
opinion draftsperson for the regi committee . - ( bg ) madam president , commissioner , colleagues , as the opinion draftsperson for the regional development committee i would like to underline the significant role of regional and local government authorities in ensuring environmental protection and sustainable development .
applying rule 50 of the rules of procedure also worked very well , allowing us to work effectively with the committee on petitions .
it suggests a sound macro-economic policy and a sound policy mix accompanied by thorough and coherent structural reforms , all based on long-term rather than short-term projections , or on the fine tuning that one might use were it possible to regulate the economy like an atomic clock to within a millionth of a second .
i would like to address my remarks to two particular dimensions of the sab , firstly on the consumer health policy unit , and secondly on the transfer of funds for the trademarks agency in alicante .
we would have liked there to be greater focus on economic , social and environmental issues , the prevention of unemployment and the fight against poverty , and solidarity with the developing countries .
the first phrase of this amendment ...
i hope that the negotiations with the first countries can soon be brought to a successful conclusion and that a target date can soon be set for the accession of these first countries .
addressing the european parliament on 26 october , in preparation for the next informal european council , the council president remarked , ‘on the working time directive , i hope that we can reach agreement under the uk presidency’ .
mr president , for the first time now , the european parliament has participated in reforming community legislation on equality by virtue of the codecision procedure .
we have held discussions on the text of recital h. in my political group , there have been certain reservations about the way mr lehne had worded it .
do they have good reason to hope ?
the debate is closed .
this , not milk quotas or public procurement rules or the structural funds , is the raison d'être of the european union , mr weber , a european area where everyone is free to arrange their lives at their own discretion .
unfortunately it does happen that persons receiving 'aid ' have to pay for it .
i am also sure that europol , which comes under the supervision of the justice and home affairs council , has regulations on auditing and accounts , etc . which are designed in a way which makes it possible to quickly discover the type of inaccuracies and irregularities mentioned by mr staes .
i feel that , if the latvian national authorities have been informed , then they will be working on the case you mention , especially as it is high on the public agenda .
therefore , it does not violate the freedom of religion .
the first is in line with the commission 's green paper on obstacles to transnational mobility in the areas of education , training and research .
europe is a continent for those who fall into line and it is only natural that we should bomb yugoslavia , a country which symbolises non-alignment .
as for mr schnellhardt’s proposed exemption for small volumes , we regard that as unnecessary .
lastly , i feel that the committee on petitions would benefit from increased resources and effective and balanced support from both the commission and the council .
did one government deal directly with the other , or were international middlemen involved ?
what , then , is the framework for good practice ?
( de ) mr president , with the greatest respect , i should like to ask why the commissioner can not read out what he has brought with him .
consultation will clearly take place in this respect , and i hope that the results of the work of this group will be useful in enlightening not only the work of the commission but also that of the other institutions , including the european parliament .
i voted against this report mainly because of its outspoken demands for the union to raise 'own resources ' .
that concludes the explanations of vote .
i should like to thank mrs lynne for all her work . i should like equally to thank mr hughes , because it is our responsibility as meps to see to it that our fellow citizens are protected .
the debate is closed .
indeed , the scope would then be greatly limited and it would mean that access to the networks for realistic prices for newcomers would be threatened .
we absolutely agree with that , but not with micro-management , and we will give parliament - you can be sure - a maximum amount of information .
we have to bear in mind that not all the problems of the outermost regions can be solved , some of them being sui generis problems , stemming from the fact that with the exception of french guyana we are dealing mostly with remote territories composed of islands and we can not change their specific geographic and structural characteristics .
firstly , ana gomes is calling for all instruments at the disposal of the commission to be used creatively with a view to reconstituting appropriate capacities in iraq in the fields of the rule of law , justice , human rights , good governance , women , health and education .
thirdly , the long-term solution is to enable developing countries to take care of their own production , which , of course , brings the developmental perspective into the equation .
the court of justice decision clearly recognised the application of internal market principles and freedoms when patients seek treatment abroad .
what this is about is getting poor countries to change their social institutions in order really to make development possible in these areas .
to this end , we need clear policy lines , coherent economic policies and stable social criteria .
i am happy to say that the consultation on state aid reform will be completed with your report .
the liberal group also supports the amendment which aims to guarantee citizens from third countries studying in the eu the right to emergency medical care as well .
the commission is proposing to amend it , with the aim of ensuring consistency between all the elements of the legislative framework , and also of clarifying the scope of some of the financed measures .
it is not only the applicant countries which need an efficient government apparatus .
at the moment , several european countries are in crisis because they concealed the correct data , and lied about the size of the budget deficit .
second point : nras .
i think the council is wrong to consider inactive working time a rest period .
– madam president , ladies and gentlemen , we welcome mr barroso as a dynamic representative of the europe which we all envision for the twenty-first century , of a europe whose main objective will be to meet the expectations of the people , by bringing different countries together in a common ambitious future , in which there must be smooth cooperation between the twenty-five countries today and , later , between more members following their integration into the european union .
should we dilute the lisbon ambitions on grounds that they are not achievable ?
the amendments tabled by my group have also supported this statement of political objectives .
it is crucially important for the cohesion fund to remain at the level initially proposed by the european commission , as it is supporting the enormous task of protecting the waters of the new eu member states .
in addition , under the temporary framework , member states could also grant state-aid guarantees for loans at a reduced premium , aid in the form of a subsidised interest rate applicable to all types of loans , and subsidised loans for the production of green products involving the early adaptation to , or going further than , the future community product standards .
i shall begin by talking about concessions and then about mixed public-private companies , which are referred to as 'institutionalised ppps ' .
in those countries which have applied for membership of the union and where capital punishment still exists we are currently witnessing how it is being abolished .
corrections to votes and voting intentions : see minutes
in my view , along with the high-level group , which i appreciate greatly , we will then need visible results from the studies that are due shortly .
i should , moreover , like to return to the issue of neighbourhood and the links you hope to foster with the entire european continent .
as author of the report on tourism in europe , i have followed mr cornillet’s work with interest .
there is new scientific evidence to suggest that public health is much affected by this .
thank you mr fatuzzo .
when mr bolkestein learns to understand this , then he may go on to share for a long time in the success which i wish mr prodi and his commission .
the media project was mentioned .
as i have already mentioned , there is a significant difference of opinion between member states concerning the contents of chapters four and five , that is , the issue of whether certain aspects of sales terms and warranties , as well as unfair contract terms , need to be fully harmonised .
in my view , it is totally inhumane to require victims of discrimination to provide proof of the discrimination .
one last point .
let me now move on to the part of the report that deals with financial assistance for the palestinians .
i would like to call for a serious discussion about the need for safe nuclear energy in europe and about the fact that europe needs this source of energy .
resumption of the session
amendment no 9 removes the ability of operators to charge subscribers for not having their particulars entered in the public directory .
i think that is quite acceptable .
we will have to start preparing soon for the future of our participation in kedo because the current agreement expires at the end of the year 2000 and we will be in close contact with parliament following the procedures i referred to earlier .
has any thought been given to the matter ?
because this is true , we have to show that the deregulation we achieved in the past in the goods transport sector is also our aim in the service sector .
it is true that indicators are not goals in themselves , but are tools that should enable us to make progress and interpret reality more globally and accurately .
let us share our cultural objectives with countries asking for entry into europe now .
however , given the rejection today of our amendment no 18 , which stated that we would do our utmost to ensure that this statute entered into force at the beginning of the next parliamentary term , parliament is showing its true colours , and on the very day and in the very week when a new system for the reimbursement of travel expenses is being adopted , a system which is supposedly based on expenses actually incurred but is actually somewhat similar to a lump-sum system .
finally , this coordination which could have been very useful in terms of cooperation and mutual exchange , risks becoming a constraint and a bureaucratic marathon .
to the national governments , too , this convention gives a legal framework for taking measures necessary to the protection – and , where necessary , also the promotion – of cultural diversity .
the voluntary approach has not worked and will not work .
we have to consider how our protests might be able to help in future .
that is why , despite all the respect that everyone in the house has for israeli independence and justice , we know that it can only be based on the laws of its country , which conflict here with international law , and that , moreover , international law does not grant it any jurisdiction over east jerusalem .
this amendment should be voted separately .
policies on social inclusion also need to be aimed at those who are most in need of them without making any kind of distinction between european citizens .
there are no differences between us , between the member states or the other basic institutions of the european union , as regards the strategy or , i think , the application of that strategy .
i have had the opportunity to speak with many , many hundreds of european citizens .
this should be reflected in the 2009 policy strategy of the commission .
violence against women and domestic violence are multidimensional problems , which have serious and wide-ranging effects on health .
on flexibility , which has been mentioned several times here today : yes , we will need flexibility if we are planning so many years ahead .
i should also like , if i may , to thank the presidency of the council for its attention in addressing an issue that is no less important for the fact that it concerns an outlying minority of the eu .
i shall not speak tonight about the contaminated blood scandals , which understandably shook this confidence and which , furthermore , brought down some political leaders who sinned through lack of vigilance , not to say incompetence .
these are the principal objectives of the social funds and account for only 15 % of their total volume .
you are selling old wine in new skins .
subject : reconstruction of iraq
first because it is close to the ground and to the heads of businesses but also , and above all , because it awards a label of technological excellence which strengthens some enterprises in obtaining bank loans .
now , however , late in the day , it is talking about a number of regulations of a domestic nature , in relation to our social security and other systems , that will have a discriminatory effect here .
clearly , when a member state and when a government which , at the time , had a majority of a hundred or so , failed to do more , as regards legislation on waste , than simply breach community directives in its attempt to find loopholes , there is a much greater likelihood of maladministration , mismanagement , crime and a total lack of compliance .
who is protecting the taliban ?
so the european parliament is being expected to continue its work on the proposal without knowing the full intentions of the commission and the council of ministers , even though as a joint legislator and a body elected by the people it is directly responsible to our citizens .
( el ) mr president , commissioner , i should like to congratulate jo leinen on his excellent report .
as for the payment deadline of 31 october , i am prepared to give further consideration to this question , though with the reservation that this must not lead to any shift in the financial year for compulsory expenditure .
the main contributors to the removal of obstacles to cross-border cooperation can be those professionals who have experience gained abroad , coupled with the appropriate language skills .
- before the vote on paragraph 15
mr president , as mrs izquierdo rojo has rightly said , the commission proposal on establishing community rules for direct payments under the common agricultural policy provides that the single payment arrangement is open to all farmers that can show that they have a valid claim .
from the point of view of the rapporteur , therefore , i can say that i am very satisfied with the result overall .
we took that step .
we welcome the recently agreed cease-fire , for a period of three months , and we hope that it will be extended , not only in time but also geographically , so that humanitarian aid can reach the people there .
it is a social responsibility that should be borne collectively by the whole of society .
mr president , the situation four years ago was as follows : at the summit in essen we agreed a broad strategy to combat unemployment more effectively at european level by strictly observing the principle of subsidiarity .
the last point is that the european parties are young parties , but not yet parties for young people .
secondly , it means setting up indicators to allow proper evaluation of the results achieved by a dialogue and informing meps of them so that , for example when a delegation visits the country , they can check what progress has been made and discuss it with civil society and human rights activists , to be better able to question their partners on the commitments made within the framework of the dialogue .
if he travels to heathrow with bmi and returns with lufthansa , he now pays eur 70 in charges .
that is also why the european year of languages falls under the umbrella of education .
( de ) mr president , the compromise which ruth hieronymi - of course with help from her colleagues - has devised here is one which i can wholeheartedly support .
this avoids the need for tyre stocks to be destroyed , which would cause additional damage to the environment .
and it is clear that he has done some extraordinary work and that this is an excellent analytical and well researched report .
i feel he has made a very good point .
i would like to stress that i could not vote in favour of the final text of the resolution because of its ideological and radical attitude to the question of abortion , an attitude which conflicts with christian values .
it is fundamental that local employment initiatives are favoured , that the cooperative , mutual and non-profit sector is supported by being guaranteed a status , that the third sector is truly recognised , including by means of public financing , this form of economy emerging between the traditional public sector and the profit sector , based on the creation of socially useful activities .
it is a step towards a european learning area , as my predecessor said during the first reading .
– mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the importance of young people’s involvement in society can not be overemphasised .
i think that this would be wrong and irresponsible of parliament , and that is why we are asking for this item to be withdrawn .
you will see in item 7 that i have been named as mr rather than mrs mcnally .
the same requirement for effectiveness must lead to the creation of a specific 'foreign affairs ' council , separate from the council . this is a point that commissioner barnier made in his speech .
of course it is entirely possible for you to establish a monitoring mechanism , as suggested by mr salafranca sánchez-neyra , mr bertens and somebody else , i am not sure whether it was mr howitt or mr newens . you have the opportunity for discussion , dialogue and meetings .
the community method means the institutions of the european union acting together and it particularly means that we must very firmly reject the intergovernmental method .
even today similar tragedies are taking place in other european countries : at sorces de clébecq 2 , 000 steel workers , 1 , 000 of them italian , are threatened with redundancy , the german miners are likewise threatened , philips on the outskirts of milan has just announced the closure of the factory which will be transferred to poland , where the danzig shipyards are closing .
it is also vital for us to negotiate on a few points in the common position which are inadequate , particularly the issue of the self-employed .
that is the fact that in parallel we have developed the fado system that allows us to compare original documents and counterfeit documents pictorially .
these people need to know that this parliament recognises their need .
i want to thank them for their diligence and the transparent way in which they have worked , even though our conclusions for next year’s budget are not the same in all respects .
most immigrants are not refugees .
that is why we need an analysis unit , which i hope we will see in amsterdam .
they clamp down only long after the matter has been resolved .
this is , of course , a very welcome tendency from parliament towards the commission .
one of these elements is application of the tests that are now available .
however , the legal basis of the directive is the environment .
the committee on industry , research and energy approved in april the penultimate stage in the legislative process by adopting by a very large majority the overall compromise on my report and the report by mrs del castillo vera .
quality requirements and sanctions go hand in hand , but these should be proportionate and encourage better management .
your successor , mr robertson , has stated in a number of interviews that the eu ' s conduct will largely remain restricted to minor , less significant conflicts .
ships can easily be bought in asia and do not necessarily have to be bought in europe .
but the finance ministers are acting as though it were an intergovernmental matter , in terms of both external representation and the role they are taking upon themselves with the euro-11 council .
the gentlemen who head our national governments get themselves terribly bogged down ; everything takes such a very long time .
the european parliament is increasingly seen by citizens as an important platform from which to defend their environment , the quality of their drinking water and their archaeological heritage .
i must keep stressing that point , because critics of the concept behave as if the green paper meant that everything was already enshrined in law .
i endorsed the resolution on the southern neighbourhood , which devotes particular attention to the situation in libya .
this presents the eu with a direct task .
lastly , madam president , i would just like to say a few brief words about the agencies .
the world anti-doping code will help to combat this scourge , but other measures are needed too .
i would characterise the challenges we face under three headings .
mr president , minister , commissioner , the assembly of the united nations has once again offered an opportunity to demonstrate the progress made since the beijing conference , as well as the problems which remain and which need to be resolved .
in any case , i call on all those who are sensitive to this issue to take the european leaders at their word : free competition is not your aim - let us see if it is not !
in writing . - i voted in favour of this first ever mobilisation of the european globalisation adjustment fund .
on the basis of the above arguments , we have voted against the motion in the final vote and against all amendments tabled which contain views on what form of employment policy the member states should pursue .
i should like to refer to another two pillars in our strategy : the question of labelling , which has been dealt with and the question of additional tax incentives for low-consumption vehicles , which is still a somewhat weak point .
. mr president , mr vice-president , ladies and gentlemen , what is termed local border traffic is a single stone in the big mosaic picture of the protection of the external borders .
the figures clearly indicate that the current organisation of this market is artificial , unfair and fails to take account of the real situation .
that was a road , and that road has led us to where we are today and i believe that today , in this comfortable inn represented by the european constitution , over the coming years we europeans are going to find it to be an effective instrument to move europe forward in peace , freedom , justice and solidarity .
you mentioned the climate change and energy package which is scheduled to be adopted by december .
this was why we asked to have a debate on mexico this week in parliament , because we knew that it was urgent .
the need for nato to maintain continued vigilance and be supported , especially in afghanistan at this present time , is essential .
by 2000 , these figures had risen to 35 % for fish meal and 60 % for fish oil and we may safely assume that this growth will continue .
we have a duty to history , a duty to protect future generations and a duty to respond to globalisation , and all the more so at this time of great uncertainty and risk when genuine , practical solidarity - not just superficial , partial solidarity - has become very important for our citizens , especially the weakest among them .
nevertheless , the european parliament does not have a duty to be a supranational court of justice .
first of all , i share your wish to resolve the long-standing issue of the statute of the members of this parliament .
... active dialogue between the council members should also be pursued between sessions .
without this , the project will be nothing more than a flash in the pan , amidst the neoliberal policies , dubbed austerity measures , which are hindering research and the quality of life for our people , particularly the elderly .
mr president , commissioner bangemann , ladies and gentlemen , there are certain reports that we have to debate and vote on in our parliament which capture our attention as a whole and which appeal to me especially .
the member states will have to enforce the rules under this regulation in the same way , and therefore i request that the european commission thoroughly monitor the correct application of this regulation by member states .
but i would point out to my british colleague that he agreed with the uk government that article 234 of the treaty did in fact render this conflict invalid .
the commission 's impact studies are based on a price of around 20 euros for a tonne of co2 .
this means that , amongst other things , the european constitution guarantees the inviolability of the current borders of the states making up the current european union .
every necessary measure needs therefore to be taken in order to improve the situation .
we should not make it a straitjacket .
we have a first draft that includes these things , i mean the budget regulation which is present in draft form .
for instance , we have already involved young children from all across europe in designing our logo .
certain russian politicians have claimed that ngos are a tool used by third countries to conduct foreign policy in russia , but these arguments are absurd and make a mockery of the concept of democracy .
procedural motions ( continued )
we must stop free-trade policies , we must stop the free movement of capital , we must encourage food sovereignty , we must declare water and energy global public goods , and we must combat socio-economic inequalities .
secondly , the region is the appropriate level of partnership for a regional development policy .
the high representative , who is currently in beirut , many kilometres to the north , knows that this is not just about palestine and israel , but also about the issue of lebanon 's security and its right to self-determination .
if you do not take them down , i shall order this parliament’s security services to do so .
if next year we are to continue to provide structural support - the internal bridge between poor and rich regions - then we need an agreement on agenda 2000 which , in small matters and in large , is characterised by solidarity , will be workable in the future and leaves no room for national egoism .
in order to prevent unfair competition in the wine market , with its disastrous consequences for our producers , it is vital for us to protect consumers by means of labelling regulations based on transparent information regarding the characteristics of the products , the techniques used , the original features and the methods of maturing the wine .
it is not about how we deal with weapons at the international level , or about arms limitation , but rather about whether we want to make it possible for the procurement of military equipment to be liberalised within the european single market .
i could say the same of the science budgets of other member states - those of france , germany , italy and plenty of others .
mr president , i would like to put on record - as i have often done before - that the cooperation we receive from the commission 's departments is extremely good .
european union citizens need to be certain that those who handle union funds and those who oversee their allocation act impartially and not with a view furthering their private interests .
i voted in favour of this project .
if the pact is to become more flexible , this should be done on the basis of objective and general criteria .
we have a duty to protect our children , who are tomorrow’s adult citizens .
one could say in legal terms that it is an anticipated form of reinforced co-operation among a few .
only when achieving some additional progress can we speak of a truly balanced fta that is acceptable and has a real and positive impact as a precedent for future ftas .
elderly european citizens must benefit from quality services and conditions , and the experience accumulated by them should be used in the ongoing development of society .
it is about more actively soliciting people’s views and , right from the beginning , taking account of these when new policy and legislation are drawn up .
the financial crisis : the world of the financial markets turns much faster than the council has reacted up to now .
finally , i would like to turn to mrs berger as i have already responded to mr beysen ' s remarks concerning small and medium-sized businesses .
you are here today , and tony blair is again absent .
i voted against this report , as it advocates capital-based pension schemes to the detriment of pay-as-you-go public pension schemes , and increasing the retirement age .
it is unfair that check-in staff at airports and at harbours , air stewardesses or ticket collectors should instead be given the right to decide who should be granted entry to the european union .
the future fund is even more specific about the role of women in fisheries than the current financial instrument for fisheries guidance .
those dues cover the costs not only of central and busy airports , but regional ones as well , small and isolated as they are , and which , because traffic through them is limited , can not meet operating expenses which are to a large extent inelastic , and can not spend what they need to on modernization investments .
on this occasion , i am happy to accept that , although i should remind members that technically they should be in the chamber to hear their name read out .
i also welcome the council’s answer to the question , but i should like some clarification .
here , obviously , the focus was mainly on flounder and turbot , and this was clearly a technical reform in the main , one which was needed when the treaty of lisbon had entered into force .
let me assure you that , in fighting and claiming his freedom , tsiakourmas is claiming freedom , peace and reconciliation for the two communities in cyprus .
the minutes of yesterday 's sitting have been distributed .
it does not mean that housing projects themselves should be given european funding .
i do not know whether it makes sense for a decision like this to be made quickly at the commission with one day to go before christmas or before the christmas holidays .
we usually use uniform criteria and , in particular , the idea that it is preferable to open areas for dialogue in order to encourage countries to make regular bilateral assessments of what is causing exclusion factors or misunderstandings .
mr president , if consumers are to be able to make the right choices and bring their might to bear , they must have access to information about products .
i therefore support this amendment . i trust the good offices of the legal services and the relevant committee will re-establish the validity of article 276 of the treaty .
if those products come onto the market now , there could be problems if we conclude , in april for example , that the granting of the application to market them was inadmissible , because by that time the products would already be on the market in every european member state except luxembourg and austria .
however , if somebody commits such an offence two or more times , then we should be able to prevent them from committing further crimes .
with regard to the economic space , during the summit , russia renewed its agreement , given in 2004 , to the gradual abolition of payments for siberian overflight rights , which are no longer justified .
the main points include the application of a new series of measures giving easier access to credit through public support for guarantee systems and a strong commitment to encouraging the cofinancing of micro-credit .
nor can it be in the interests of our greek friends to see turkey as a factor of instability in an islamic world , facing away from europe .
the commission is looking forward to this .
that agreement is not binding , although there is an implicit or stated commitment for us to reach a binding agreement within the current year .
children who are the subject of abusing images carry their feelings of pain , guilt and suffering for the rest of their lives .
at laeken a consultative committee must certainly be set up , to commence drafting a constitution for the european union and to deliberate on fundamental issues .
we warmly welcome them and are delighted to welcome them to this joint debate .
they get cold in other parts of europe when in ukraine the president and prime minister engage in a power struggle .
an adult might understand this , but a child does not .
there is some basis for this , because we have a formidable advantage .
now it is time to rectify this .
that is one of the main routes by which counterfeit drugs end up on the european market .
i simply hope that the lisbon strategy can help us to move forward for the sake of all our fellow citizens .
that means that there is even suspicion that in countries where we are trying to help the population a little , budget support is partly being used by corrupt and totalitarian regimes to suppress undesirable population groups or even critics .
could you advise on this amendment 's admissibility in the light of this massive extension of eu powers ?
we have heard here , admittedly , that this extension of the transitional period from three to four years is not desirable , but i believe that it is much more important for us to guarantee that all products will be placed on the market legally and that a proper evaluation of these products will be carried out .
mr president , this communication from the commission deals with a key issue for the developing countries : how can the fisheries policy conducted by these countries help reduce poverty ?
on the subject of the use of european funds , we must mention the integrated administration and control system , which is an excellent system but causes huge problems when it has been implemented because it is based on incorrect databases and is also hampered due to the identification of the parcels to be used .
why should europe get involved in the far reaches of outer space ?
this is because no company is going to accept its implications in terms of investment and change , unless it knows that it will be guaranteed the possibility of having access to the free circulation of information .
this agreement is in keeping with our strategy for sustainable development while encouraging our economies to be competitive and guaranteeing the principle of equity : if the user pays , he must not pay twice .
i am picking up mr cushnahan 's question here because , unfortunately , he had to leave .
we know that many evening sittings have preceded this one in our effort to bring about a reform treaty and its ratification in 26 parliaments of the member states .
i would also like to thank the commission for presenting an effective communication containing innovative proposals , which parliament wishes to strengthen and promote through the esteve report .
our objective is to have a global agreement on climate change and to participate in the copenhagen climate change conference with proposals that will encourage others to move .
it does not need to be .
twenty-five countries out of 27 and the overwhelming majority of parliament support a proposal that regulates the field of patents and that has a real effect on the most innovative enterprises and those that are most orientated to international markets .
those caring for patients should be guaranteed appropriate financial and psychological support .
i also feel bound to point out that we should not lose sight of the fact that tacis is , to a large extent , a trompe l'oeil window : however much we improve the window catches , they are merely 'painted on ' , and the window will still not open .
a good policy on health at work must begin by being preventive and the idea of prevention must to a large extent include awareness , not only on the part of workers and employers , but also on the part of society as a whole .
i think the results we have achieved in spite of this are a more than adequate response to the doubting voices that said that the czech republic , for objective and subjective reasons , was not up to the task of leading the eu .
tibetans must be guaranteed the right to be educated in their own language and to deal with official matters in the tibetan language .
unfortunately , there are many countries - as we have also heard in the debate here - which have not yet implemented the existing directives , and this is a huge problem .
on behalf of the pse group . - mr president , first of all we want to call on the burmese regime : to release political opponents and the more than 1 800 political prisoners , including aung san suu kyi , the leaders of the '88 generation students and the leaders of the shan nationalities league for democracy arrested in 2005 ; to account for all the casualties and missing persons from last september 's crackdown on protests by buddhist monks and democracy activists , including the whereabouts of missing monks and nuns ; to secure access to burma for the incoming un special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in burma and to permit opposition political parties to meet with the special envoy .
we will have to come back to it later .
instead , the pathetic situation arose in which the leaders of the large groups appeared as 'professional mourners ' , giving their assurances that their refusal to give discharge was really only pretend .
i wish to stress once again that eu or un forces should immediately replace russia 's so-called peacekeeping armed forces in abkhazia .
in that communication we emphasised that despite excellent research and development capacities in certain key enabling technologies , we are not managing to achieve proportionate success when it comes to transforming those results into manufacturing products and services .
i should like to stress once again that we must be very careful when it comes to using genetically engineered drugs for preventative purposes .
what measures will be taken , what projects are to be implemented in the countries to ensure that not only agricultural areas , not only rural areas would be getting support , so that new workplaces are created in other regions as well ?
this report was actually split into two .
for my part , taxation is sacrosanct to each member state .
member of the commission . - mr president , this will be a very short reply .
currency dealing and speculation are regarded as more productive forms of business .
one of the most important changes concerns the staff culture .
the function and strength of the internal market depend precisely on how effectively we can agree and implement acts at european level in those areas where they are needed .
rapporteur . - mr president , i made a full statement about this last night .
you must not pre-empt the decisions of parliament in these matters .
we are not aware that barriers exist to the freedom of movement of this equipment , but we attach great importance to eliminating , at national level , administrative or bureaucratic complications in this area .
i ask commissioner nielson if he can give us a time-scale as to when that might be brought forward during the course of next year so we can deal with it properly in the budget process .
we all have to work together in this field .
this is why action is needed .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , first i wish to thank you sincerely for the opportunity to come here and discuss the informal summit of the heads of state or government in lahti , to be held on 20 october .
what relationship does it bear ?
i do not think that any political force in this chamber can claim a monopoly on european ideas .
our hope of seeing a reunited island joining the union has not materialised .
i do not agree with the theory that the euro ' s development is leading to a fall in employment in europe and an increase in employment in the usa .
i feel that this is genuinely important , because people are the raw material of the european union , and any kind of investment in people - whether in terms of providing them with qualifications , further training or lifelong learning , or through accompanying measures such as research and development and support for innovation - will help us to make real progress within the european union .
in writing . - ( sv ) this report recommends the amendment of an existing directive on ship-source pollution .
the rapporteur 's recommendations on the necessary diversification of our aid programmes , on their decentralisation , on improved capillary action and on the extension of micro-loans seem relevant because they are well suited to the social and geographic structures of india .
the information sheet should be designed to include all the data needed to check how the loan is calculated . this means , in particular , the manner in which advance and deferred interest is calculated .
finally , i welcome the fact that the most recent statements do not question the independence of the european central bank .
so i think we should wholeheartedly endorse this proposal , together with some of the amendments .
there should be no carte blanche for the lukashenko regime .
chile is going to need international loans , and the european investment bank , with which chile has just signed an agreement , should help with the financing of the reconstruction projects .
for that , of course , will not only be crucial in terms of the aspirations of the citizens of that region ; the stability , prosperity and democratisation of the states of that region will also undoubtedly be a very important element of our own security .
i should like to say a word about the enlargement of the euro zone .
those were some of our priorities .
mr president , in our view , we must not forget that greater fleet capacity does not guarantee employment .
whether the customer lives in the country , in an isolated valley or in a town , they are charged the same price per kw/hour .
we must try to make the effort .
mr president , i understand completely that you have difficulties in foreseeing the future .
such cooperation goes beyond the purely formal aspects , that is to say when the legal basis allows us to acknowledge him explicitly in the procedure , but extends to cases where we want to make sure in advance that the personal data protection rules are being observed .
mr president , i quote from a recent article in the british press : ‘britain’s booming wine industry will be scuppered by eu regulations that want to prohibit growers in britain , all of them unsubsidised , from planting any more vines if their sales continue to soar’ .
so why do you need more money if you can not spend the money you have ?
however , if the uk were to join the system , the exchange rate on entry would this time - unlike last time - have to be set by agreement with the other eu member states .
no , at a time when laboratories are challenging the consciences of the whole world , i would like parliament to insist that we all have the same dignity and the same humanity .
but to what extent can this really be considered a success ?
i think that this view needs to be reflected in the eu 2020 strategy .
integration capacity can not therefore be a further criterion to be added to the copenhagen criteria , but rather a condition that we apply to ourselves as a union , in order to ensure that enlargement is a success .
the next item is the joint debate on the :
the vote will take place on 14 december 2005 .
but we see no readiness on the part of the council at this moment to make any commitment on that point .
well then , i do not see why the same pragmatic attitude , based on a positive and motivational approach – and not simply one that is sanctions-based and punitive – can not also be applied to cuba .
serbia is a crucial part of that with this commitment ...
we shall continue to coordinate and provide additional support for the measures taken by the member states to promote energy efficiency and better dissemination of information .
the development of a european code of conduct is a very important aim which we must pursue vigorously .
these resources can not be transferred for other purposes .
we can only achieve this by means of an integrated and sustainable policy .
for example , if we assume that the euro is strong against the dollar , the european countries not participating in the euro zone will perhaps find that they are at an advantage by retaining more reasonable exchange rate parities .
. the unanimous vote in the committee on agriculture demonstrates the consensus in this house as regards the issue of providing information on and promoting agricultural products in third countries and in the internal market .
as regards structural funds , we have considerable payment requirements , due both to the implementation of the new instrument of agenda 2000 but also to the vast weight of past commitments .
we have had debates , and we have not always been in agreement , but i believe that in the end we have always produced good work to bring to the plenary session of this parliament .
systematic theft or the systematic counterfeiting of credit cards , for example , should also be included .
the last word has not been said on this subject .
up to now i have not heard the commissioner say that he would not follow parliament 's wish on this point .
taking into account the level of market penetration , it is above all american authors who are protected .
we can not just put it off .
lawlessness reigns supreme , and human rights violations are legion .
thank you , commissioner . i would ask you to communicate what i have said to commissioner wallström , so that at second reading we can approve the amendments which parliament has already approved .
in short , the rapporteur sees the population question in the developing countries as coming down to a woman’s control of her body : it seems to us that a wider reading of the problem and one closer to reality in all its aspects would have been more useful , and also more respectful of the different approaches taken , within the union , to a sensitive subject like abortion .
( el ) mr president , the current lisbon strategy has simply been renamed europe 2020 strategy .
the minutes show this resolution to have been adopted by parliament when in fact it was rejected by an overwhelming majority .
mr hatzidakis , in my opinion helsinki represented a moment of great balance in terms of the concerns of those involved , namely greece , turkey and also cyprus as a third party .
as far as the applicability of an opt-in regime outside europe is concerned , the gatt agreement allows its members to take measures to enforce their data protection legislation within their territory .
everyone has to make the effort ; that is why environmental costs need to be internalised .
secondly , when , in the course of this summer , can the members of this house expect to see the actual commission proposals ?
our country has been gradually dragged into this conflict .
that mr evans , the rapporteur , being british , should speak up for open coordination is not that surprising , but it is quite remarkable that you should adduce the community employment policy as an example of how this method has been successfully used , as you have obviously not been following the current employment situation and the state of the labour market in the eu , otherwise you would be well aware of how open coordination has failed in this area .
this therefore makes it the responsibility of every one of us , including parliament and the current presidency , to ensure that the most vulnerable do not end up in a precarious situation .
. mr president , illegal or clandestine immigration does not only involve people .
let me specify , however , that the council has not yet discussed the initiatives put by the united kingdom to the united nations security council , nor has it established contact with the largest diamond importers with a view to preventing the illegal trade in diamonds .
we must set common rules guaranteeing a high level of environmental protection for all facilities in the european waste recovery market .
as the new commissioner for energy , i would therefore like to involve this house extensively in all future policy measures as far as possible and at an early stage .
i feel that it is much more important - and so do all the pensioners who sent me to the european parliament - and would be much more useful to combat illegal immigration into europe by stepping up controls at europe 's borders .
i should point out that of the 52 factory ships that existed in 1990 , only 14 are still operational .
madam president , mr president , france is assuming the presidency of the european union for the next six months .
madam president , first of all a word to thank the house for having agreed to include , although its priorities were already set last week , the subject of the fire of lisbon city hall on the agenda .
the purpose of the report adopted today is to establish parliament 's position with regard to a new financing instrument for european union development cooperation , based on the lessons drawn from our scrutiny of the implementation of the development cooperation instrument ( dci ) .
so , i believe that a policy of friendship and cooperation , while at the same time putting forward european interests using the bilateral and multilateral means at our disposal combined with support for japan playing a larger role in the world , as mr moorhouse has suggested , and by us assisting in that process through being ready to participate ourselves , as in kedo , and to put our money where our mouth is .
it must be capable of evolving in step with society because educational systems suffer when they are not rooted in life .
in the severest wave of repression for ten years the dictator wants to rid himself of dissidents who are disagreeable to him .
in addition , however , the boundaries between olaf and other entities with investigative powers , in particular idoc , need to be more clearly defined .
madam president , european states brought tribes together in colonies in africa that did not have good relations with each other , and divided other tribes by drawing boundaries right through the middle of their lands .
the proposal is no doubt based on good intentions , but both the proposal itself and its amended version lead me to question what its effects are likely to be in practice for labour-intensive companies , including many smes .
we are now probably at about half the stocks that we historically have and stocks are getting low , so now is the time to do it .
we have tabled a moderate compromise , only 15 % auctioning and 85 % free , but even this 15 % auctioning will give a positive signal to industry that has made an early start on co2 reduction .
they now have the chance to establish themselves using a sustainable business model .
secondly , in this regard it is significant that , in 2007 , thousands of airbus employees lost their jobs as a result of a restructuring that , in my opinion , was not necessary - after years of huge profits for this european consortium .
