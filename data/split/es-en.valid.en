in connection with my recently completed report on the pension funds directive , i also believe that simplification and consolidation of the life assurance directives is urgently required , because that will create clearer distinctions between the different activities and pillars .
mr president , on a point of order .
so it makes more sense to us to tell the council of ministers , and the commission too , what we want done to prevent postage stamps going up in price .
this is certainly true of the foreign affairs field where the old certainties of the cold war are now at an end and have been replaced by a situation of much greater uncertainty and insecurity .
finally , commissioner patten has said that we do not necessarily need institutional revolution , perhaps just reforms .
then comes the question of quantity : how much ?
the time has now come when the west must immediately pull the carpet from under mr musharraf 's feet and provide support , not for him , but for the democratic reform forces in pakistan .
presumably the english version is `` more proportional '' .
calling it independent involves defining what it is independent from and taking steps to ensure that its political counterpart is as strong as it is , failing which there will be no equilibrium .
it is also worth considering one additional issue : the consumption of alcohol and alcohol dependence , especially in young people , goes hand in hand with other addictions , which combine and often lead to tragedy .
two and a half years on and with the terrible disaster in canada fresh in our minds , little has improved in practice .
however , as vice-president almunia announced to the committee on economic and monetary affairs in november , the commission will analyse the effects on competition of the temporary state aid measures taken in the context of the crisis .
this european fund was set up to provide additional support to workers who lose their jobs because of changes in world trade .
– mr president , i join in the warm thanks expressed by all my fellow members to mrs echerer .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
for goodness sake , wake up .
today – or rather tomorrow , in fact – we face a very tricky decision .
in the meantime , as i said , the court of justice has given a large number of judgments in this area , so it is a matter of importance that there is now this new proposal for a directive , which is actually based on the judgments of the court and initiated through the protocol on social policy , so that it should be easier to reach agreement on the final text .
everyone else will be the losers - not least very sick people who will see their hopes of a cure crushed when the free development of new experience and methods are suffocated by the monopoly on knowledge and the demand for licence fees which will come in the wake of the patent directive .
the competitiveness of rail is being hampered by a variety of things .
in the context of the european commission guidelines describing the conditions for state intervention , we believe that it is entirely possible to include support for single wagon load transport , whether in the form of compensation for public-service obligations or in the form of aid for ...
further to the conclusions devoted to iraq it seems rather to be cast as a humanitarian ngo .
the first of these problems concerns our relations with the south , in the event the producer countries .
in conclusion i would like to thank the rapporteur again for the quality of this report .
this point needs serious attention .
violence could break out at any moment as the political crisis goes on , with unforeseeable consequences for the country and its people .
i trust that the commission 's proposal can now go forward for rapid adoption by the council , amended , as of course it will be , following parliament 's opinion .
still it has to be said that the amendments in mrs zimmerman 's report are generally aimed in the right direction .
the difficulties are clear from the number of current directives alone - there are `` only '' fourteen on today 's subject .
this is not a very uplifting image to take to the ballot boxes .
pursuant to the committee on culture and education 's stance , it may also serve to support cultural diversity but only on condition that fair principles and transparency are guaranteed .
i should like to thank mrs gebhardt , mr harbour and also commissioner mccreevy for the excellent work that has been done .
there is far too little of that at present . we also need greater use to be made of the new technologies in combating fraud .
we should not downplay the situation .
or are you of the view that there is no point , that it will wait for the next us administration ?
you also raised the issue of european enlargement , mr balkenende .
they represent new resources for the member states in that they have not been distributed hitherto , but have been released in tranches .
there is only one thing i think goes a little over the top and that is the idea of a european defence minister to supplement our foreign minister .
this obliged the council of ministers to sit around the negotiating table with parliament with a view to reaching a position that would express the common will of both institutions .
sadly , though , the opt-out will fade out as the european court of justice sets about its centralising agenda .
it makes no sense to build up europe while seeking to destroy china , but failure to respect human rights puts china 's stability at risk .
and we can not do that in order to assuage any guilt we may feel for our lack of action .
thirdly , our aim is to establish a common register for interest representatives in the eu institutions . it remains to be seen whether this really will happen with the commission and parliament .
any re-admission agreement between the european union and libya has to exclude all those who claim to be asylum seekers , refugees or persons requiring international protection , and it must be applied completely in accordance with the principle of non-refoulement .
mr president , honourable member , the talks about kosovo are currently taking place under the aegis of the united nations .
in this respect , the regulation is quite simply being ignored by the office’s investigators .
removing these women from assistance aimed at helping these most vulnerable people is as illogical as it is inhuman .
we condemn the abuse of personal data in lists used for political persecution along totalitarian guidelines , such as the 'tascón list ' , 'maisanta list ' and 'russián list ' .
rapporteur . - madam president , i would like to thank colleagues and innovative citizens for all their very valuable contributions .
treaty of nice and the future of the eu
but those criteria have first been looked at unilaterally by the council .
we must introduce effective forms of cooperation with some of our neighbours , especially in the mediterranean and the balkans , in the field of control and management of migration flows .
in writing .
in portugal , 90 % of the present fishing fleet consists of vessels less than 12 metres long used for small-scale coastal fishing .
seventhly , we need clear rules about the openness of information intended for the general public .
we need to have this political courage , and i do not think that it would hamper a country 's ability to welcome incomers if we were to say : 'this is our constitution , these are our rules , these are our human values , and you must comply with them .
in this respect , i am happy to inform you that the manual for ‘integrating environment concerns into development and economic cooperation’ will be finalised and made operational during the first half of this year .
it is not much fun , of course , having to discuss transparency and intergovernmental conferences with yourself .
one of our conservative friends has also quite rightly pointed out that there are undeniably ways of using and distributing water more efficiently in the southern countries .
( pl ) we are indeed discussing human rights violations in russia on a day of significant symbolic value .
it is vital to support initiatives like those taken by the spanish presidency , which has declared equality between men and women to be one of its priorities .
last but not least , i am convinced that by removing existing regulatory restrictions this agreement will lead to a substantial increase in passengers and generate various consumer benefits and the creation of new jobs .
poor economic decisions are also poor social decisions .
the regulation of these funds forms part of a broader regulation of the financial sector , aimed at preventing a repeat of the financial crisis .
there is a leader , mr nasrallah , who is the political and military leader , and who claims that they are an organisation .
the pace of change is hotting up in the european economy .
i consider this to be an amazing change .
it falls to the high representative , now equipped with the power of initiative , under article 30 of the treaty , to propose and lead a true european strategy to assist in the closing of guantánamo as quickly as possible , ensuring the necessary support for the individual recovery and social reintegration of released persons , including their right to family reunification .
in writing . - ( pt ) a common legal framework for consumer credit must lay down clear , simple and concise rules , so as to offer european added value with the aim of promoting the internal market .
.– it is an insult to debate the financial perspectives for 2007-2013 , when their declared aim is to implement the new constitutional treaty which has been rejected , condemned and is dead .
it would appear that three different routes are being debated .
for this reason , i believe the proposal for a directive was necessary .
thank you very much , commissioner .
mr president , here in the european parliament , we recently adopted a resolution on ukraine in which we questioned the granting by the former president of ukraine of a high state award to stepan bandera , a leader of the struggle for the country 's independence .
you also just said that it is highly unfortunate that moody 's has downgraded greece 's credit rating .
the only thing that we ask of you is not to organise consultations on financial compensation today , but to produce a text which corresponds to the demands of civil society and of the european parliament . the present text , which you will be presenting to the commission in three days’ time , does not correspond to those demands .
on behalf of the gue/ngl group . - ( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , after the resolution was approved by this parliament , we went to visit roma camps and we were able to see with our own eyes how they welcome people and how they live .
fifthly , huge numbers of people die in road traffic accidents , almost as many as the number of people who die in major wars .
if i may now speak on the area in which i have been heavily involved , with the white paper on youth , the new youth programme and the old one , i have to say that , as a result of their increasing contacts through the recent consultation processes , youth organisations and the european youth forum have had their expectations raised very high .
firstly , i want to reinforce those comments about the way in which your first failure as president of the european union was to side automatically with mr clinton , without even consulting the european union , on the question of the threat from baghdad and the threat to bomb baghdad .
it is generally known that the railway sector is of crucial importance in terms of europe ' s future transport needs and a more sustainable european transport system .
europe currently has everything it needs to re-establish sustainable growth , which is yet another reason for associating a more ambitious social goal to our economic and monetary objectives .
economic and social cohesion in europe is facing its second test within a short period of time .
i salute the balance and leadership that karl von wogau has brought to it .
in order to meet this challenge effectively , the european union must implement a policy of prevention , employing the most appropriate foreign policy instruments with a view to addressing the causes of instability directly , so that emigration becomes an opportunity , not a desperate necessity .
in writing . - ( pt ) following the implementation of the us legislative reform that reinforced security requirements under the visa waiver programme , the usa decided to propose separate memoranda of understanding to each member state in an attempt to divide and rule .
relating to the joint resolution on chechnya
at the same time , however , it has left the way open for a european regulation process which , if developed , would violate that subsidiarity and once again lead to protests in a few years’ time against intervention from brussels .
finally , we need to ask what can be done to make the constitutional text possible ?
there is a growing tendency for large enterprises to force small and medium-sized ones off the market , with a significant impact on the livelihood of the local communities .
nevertheless , it must be realized that there are quite a few problems in applying the measures being taken to remedy this situation , which was created by the pyramid fraud .
for my final point , there is something of which i feel i must remind you : foreign policy also presupposes that we possess good and effective instruments with the appropriate capacity .
you said my evidence is based on what the ciett has said to me .
in today 's debate , however , we have clearly felt , among certain speakers , the beginnings of a slide towards a sort of anti-american exaltation .
that must be the goal of all the efforts that we undertake over the forthcoming days , weeks and months , including here in the european parliament .
one thing is certain , however : there is not a 'possible ' un plan : this is the only one .
the new protocol will be concluded for a three-year period ( 2011-2013 ) , starting with the entry into force of the council decision on the provisional application of said protocol and following the expiry of the protocol in force .
another brief point : the issue of inflation .
for those businesses too , and for small and medium-size enterprises in general , we would like to introduce uniform european legislation that enables them to operate within the internal market but that is simple legislation at the same time , as mr gauzès stated , in fact , with only one port of call and one set of rules , as is the case with extensible business reporting language ( xbrl ) , which means they will not be saddled with an enormous administrative burden as is currently the case .
the european parliament 's committee on women 's ' rights has opened the bottle labelled 'discrimination against women in advertising ' .
however , the european union will continue to carefully monitor this problem and will certainly raise this issue with the egyptian authorities regardless of whether the agreement has been signed .
a general link between databases would suffice .
i will be voting accordingly .
president-in-office of the council .
for my part i would not exclude the fact that it would be wise to search for a suitable ways and means to organize things in order to achieve a real mastery of these problems .
we must find common and national methods which are effective .
from a budgetary point of view , their problem lies in the discrepancy between the payment appropriations and the payments which were actually made .
i would therefore speak for quality rather than mobility .
all the more , it is unacceptable to leave the process in the hands of multinationals , because the interests they represent are not the best guarantee of respect for the integrity of human life .
a new agreement must provide greater protection of the personal data of european citizens .
we recognise the case for a complementary and alternative satellite radio navigation system .
i therefore support the verde i aldea report , which is a big step forward in consumer protection .
the kdp now controls the majority of iraqi kurdistan and is said to have promulgated an amnesty and allowed the parliament to meet after being paralysed for two years .
the truth is that there are agreements , there are declarations , there is the fifa code , there are mechanisms banning child labour .
i think that you were right just now to recall our decision to invite president arafat and mr peres .
as a coordinator on the regional development committee and an mep for wales , it was with great concern that i received a leaked copy of a draft communication of the european commission entitled a reform agenda for a global europe : reforming the budget , changing europe .
i welcome the initiative of the commission with regard to collective redress , which is a long-overdue initiative .
even with this progress , the gender pay gap remains a serious cause of concern .
the commission must certainly seek to recruit the trust of the foreign ministries of the member states , but it also needs to preserve the special prerogatives and experience that it has acquired over decades across the policy spectrum , from development to the environment and , of course , including trade .
under the regime 's critics , she enjoyed a privileged position for years .
we are open to this .
there are things to change and i think now is the time to change them .
last week the supreme court in the usa pronounced the special military tribunals appointed by president bush in november 2001 by way of a decree , bypassing congress , as illegal and contrary to the geneva conventions and the american system of military courts .
however , at the moment it is banked with bankers , although article 109c does not specify whether representatives should come from national banks or from economic and finance ministries .
i wanted to get out on the tenth floor .
paragraph 27 ( b ) should begin ‘to create 46 posts ( 21 a* , 1 temporary a* , 19 b* and 5 c* ) ’ .
finland’s ?
being critical is a rare commodity in both the council and the commission .
as the intergovernmental conference opens - a conference which has set itself the particular objective of drawing closer to europe 's citizens - the subject under discussion is one of concrete and , unfortunately , daily concern to our citizens .
deep sea fishing -here is an area unique in its case which proves the rule that this working time directive is fraught with practical problems .
it is vitally important that counterfeit money be detected , including the use of counterfeit coins in machines .
but just as parliament must protect business and the freight industry , so europe - but not exclusively the united kingdom or france - has a duty to care for and protect those seeking refuge .
what mr geier said is absolutely correct , but we are not calling that into question .
i think mrs mann has produced an absolutely outstanding piece of work .
thank you very much , commissioner barnier .
the commission also reinforced its concern at a meeting in brussels with the ambassador of mozambique .
a strong commission may be helpful , but a strong commission in that respect is indispensable .
it is regrettable that the net payers mainly focus on the revenue side of the budget .
we must manage the finances of the eu concerning maritime issues in the context of the european commission 's proposal for a regulation to finance the integrated maritime policy in 2011 , 2012 and 2013 .
that takes time and money , mrs corbey .
the very title of this report is misleading in itself .
finally , whilst i understand what he says about high standards of animal welfare already being regulated by eu legislation , this is not always enforced , as he is aware .
i should like to refer very briefly to the more basic amendments which we are unable to accept .
in this respect , it is absolutely necessary that the oil companies make the necessary efforts .
if we do all those things , we will indeed bring about a small but not insignificant improvement .
mr president , one word of explanation .
this permits the kind of progress we hope to see .
for this sort of solution , however , it must be guaranteed that all parties involved pay their fair share and that it does not result in a few airlines , including low cost airlines , sitting back in comfort and letting others bear the risk .
the second reason is that european consumers do not know that they are buying these products .
i think this agreement is ambitious as well as realistic .
they will read the text .
from now on it will be up to them .
an agreement that can stand up , which is ambitious as well as balanced .
its use in comparison with other countries is still too limited .
however violent the earthquake was , it alone does not explain the extent of the damage .
there are more than 300 000 refugees from kosovo in albania .
of course we are waiting anxiously for the decision of the danish people .
opening of the sitting
i believe that is the right way to go about this because the response can be made more quickly in the comitology or secondary legislation procedure , rather than putting this into a piece of legislation as has been suggested in the amendment .
i can now say that relations with the president of the eurogroup are excellent , our contacts have been continuous and the preparation of meetings has improved considerably .
in this respect , we must make an effort to act as responsibly as possible .
this is what the president told us .
subject : human rights in colombia
i think we all now realise that multilateral relations and decentralised cooperation - which were perhaps the most worthwhile of the barcelona instruments - are faltering , whereas bilateral relations between the eu and the member states are suffering from all the problems linked to ratification dates which have been recalled by mr marín .
this denies consumers the right to know which substances they are dealing with and it also makes it more difficult for users to identify the substances in various databases .
at the same time , we must not lose sight of the long-term challenges .
you might think i am making it all up , but just last week president barroso said : 'as a prime minister i was in favour of a referendum [ on the constitution ] ' .
it is said for example that the democratic deficit must be overcome by strengthening the national parliaments ' capacity to act within the processes of european construction .
i mentioned just now the general agreement on trade in services , for example .
my group favours less competition between countries as regards tax levels themselves , and to let them compete instead on what they achieve with the tax money .
12 to 16 january 28 to 29 january 16 to 20 february 9 to 13 march 25 to 26 march 14 to 17 april 29 to 30 april 11 to 15 may 15 to 19 june 1 to 2 july 13 to 17 july 14 to 18 september 5 to 9 october 19 to 23 october 4 to 5 november 16 to 20 november 2 to 3 december 14 to 18 december
i quote : ' ? is willing to consider entering appropriations for the extension of the current health insurance scheme to former members and looks forward to detailed proposals being submitted in due course . '
the next item is the joint debate on two reports by mr blokland , on behalf of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy :
it will be possible to influence this to some degree by the use of renewable energy sources and by improving energy efficiency , but i do not myself take the view that we can bring about any fundamental about-turn in this trend .
this report contains a number of points of special interest which look like they might quietly disappear from the table of the summit in luxembourg .
i hope that in future reports they will always form an integral part of the report , as well as benchmarking in the sphere of labour market strategy .
however , paragraph 6 of the report contains wording that could be interpreted to the effect that compromises made in amsterdam and luxembourg in the area of employment are devoid of tangible content .
providing public information on the recipients of eu funds is a cornerstone of the european transparency initiative ( eti ) .
i also note with encouragement that the summit outcome contains a resolution to 'strengthen the united nations human rights machinery with the aim of ensuring effective enjoyment by all of human rights ' .
the objectives are clear : strengthening free competition , and speeding up the process of liberalisation and privatisation of various sectors of economic activity and social life .
this is a cross-border criminal activity .
we socialists fear that , with those enticing words , you intend to do something quite different in fact , namely to press europe into the conservative corner .
there is obviously always the possibility of there being complex difficulties in these relations , and there can also be disagreements , but the relationship between the european union and russia is a broad and multifaceted one . we have growing economic and trade links , and - we have to admit - a high level of interdependency with regard to energy , common interests in other areas that relate to problems that go beyond even our respective countries , and challenges , including global challenges , which we need to tackle and which we should tackle as jointly as possible .
in the face of such blindness , irresponsibility and inadequacy i intend to vote against the report .
since 2006 , a european regulation has obliged all road hauliers driving in europe to respect the same maximum daily driving limit and to take rest periods in order to guarantee safety on european roads .
in future , the simplification process may be extended to other european programmes , notably the structural funds .
it needs an instrument of political cooperation .
as revealed recently in parliament by the organisation , cuba is currently the world’s largest prison for journalists .
i also believe that it is essential to shorten the procedures for rolling out projects aimed at finding alternative and unconventional sources of energy .
they informed the police who took no action and even refused to give their names .
to conclude , i can declare that i shall be supporting this report .
that initiative certainly was not a programme for retraining those unemployed or made redundant within the industry .
i just wanted to point that out .
the member states ' convergence programmes are now at an advanced level of commitment , and those commitments need to be sustained in the long term .
mr president , as regards tourism , over 40 members of the european parliament have tabled two amendments in which we ask that the same number of similar amendments by the committee on transport , which the committee on budgets strangely rejected , should again be included in the budget .
developments on this issue mean that we can expect the regulation to be quickly approved and i would once again like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work and parliament as a whole for its approval , like the council , foregoing the need to resort to conciliation .
in 2006 , the commission launched a study on sport academies in member states , including the issue of home-grown players .
the committee was also struck by the fact that other central banks have moved more rapidly in recent years towards greater openness .
. the main function of the european investment bank ( eib ) is , in conjunction with the european investment fund , to support capital investment that promotes sustainable development and economic and social cohesion .
as for the green paper , i believe it is adequate and that we should make progress on european repatriation policies .
rapporteur . - commissioner , the maritime service agreement can not be overestimated .
there are three words i would leave you with if i may - openness , flexibility and innovation .
only on one particular point did it prove impossible to reach an agreement .
recently ukraine has made arrangements for russian funding to be available and it is imperative that the ebrd makes up its mind as to the g7 contribution to this project .
however , we realise that the fact that two member states rejected the proposed constitution meant that we were forced to make changes .
that is true and you are absolutely right .
i do not want to build up large structures where people create work while waiting for a crisis to happen .
i would remind the house that issues relating to employment and labour law have been removed from the scope of the directive , which should allay the fears expressed by the trade unions .
thank you , colleague , but please do not put two questions during your one minute , because it is very difficult for president barroso to answer two questions in one minute .
european structures were joined by nations that had long been isolated by force from them , even though the values that lie at the heart of the european union had historically been rooted in these nations .
cooperation with the former yugoslavia has also been allocated substantial funding .
first of all , there are a few reasons why we can not rehire the teachers , the first of which is financial : such hiring would be incompatible with the financial regulation in two aspects , the first of which is procurement and the second is the principle of sound financial management .
romania has therefore taken an important step towards joining the schengen area , scheduled for 2011 .
president .
( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i shall confine myself to asking the high representative , baroness ashton , to place a specific request on the agenda of our relations with egypt : we call on the egyptian authorities to remove information on religion from official documents , identity cards , passports and all documents needed to obtain work .
i would like at the same time to thank the rapporteur , mrs ghilardotti , for leading us to that compromise , which is now very close to the common position .
mr president , as draftsman of the opinion of the committee on women’s rights and gender equality , i am happy to welcome the content of mr howitt’s report , particularly the sensitivity he has shown in terms of dealing with the gender perspective in a transversal manner .
indeed , we are almost ahead of schedule !
we agree with that and have therefore chosen to vote against the report as a whole .
thirdly , it proposes an evaluation of the consequences for the acp countries , but on an a posteriori basis , which is problematic indeed .
the problem is that there is really no indication of exactly where the ecu 7 million involved is coming from .
the coming weeks and months will demonstrate whether the authorities in belarus are finally committed to take the path towards freedom , democracy and an improvement in human rights .
carping aside , the overall direction is good and the objectives are noble .
this was one of the questions raised in goma , but i am raising it here because of all the other similar situations throughout the world .
you can not criticize what has been done , deplore what has not been done , and then approve the commission programme .
now , parliament as a whole , must show science , medicine and business in the union ' s member states the way forward for the biotechnological revolution .
i have a very specific question for the commissioner .
for our part , we consider the proposal the commission has made of using a flexibility instrument in the budget to be acceptable , and we regret that the matter was not made clearer during the first reading of the budget by the european parliament , inserting the amounts on the line and requesting the use of the flexibility instrument , as in fact the committee on fisheries had proposed , as our chairman has just reminded us .
this reflects very well the debate on the multiannual budget .
it is important for us constantly to monitor developments and use the best possible methods .
the changes that have taken place are so profound that we can not allow ourselves to paralyse this march towards freedom just because some wish to ensure a reduction in their contribution to the community coffers after 2006 .
in relation to that enlargement , i would like to highlight a statement contained in the introduction to the council’s decision .
the commission should also play a more active role in coordinating the implementation of this strategy in order to prevent it from failing as disastrously as the lisbon strategy .
in the programmes in category 4 where we see high utilization in meda and low utilization in tacis , the group of the european people 's party does not feel that we should necessarily be voting all the credits for meda next year but put tacis in the reserve .
the diverse climatic , geographical and structural conditions in which wine grapes are grown in europe have to be taken into consideration .
the commission quite rightly calls that rural development policy a 'second pillar ' .
the committee on budgets voted its second reading amendments , further to the conciliation outcome , on 29 november 2007 .
the concept of a living landscape that balances the needs of nature with the needs of man is the basis of the thinking that underpins natura 2000 .
presently , the focus seems to be on near-term , fast-start finance , but we also need long-term commitments .
it will also raise the significance and credibility of numerous initiatives of the european parliament in the area of the protection of fundamental freedoms , which are the right of every person .
instead , in his mind , she is reduced to a body that can be bought .
vice-president of the commission . - mr president , first of all , thank you very much for this lively and interesting debate .
we are talking here about the donors , the question of screening , evaluation and testing and also the question of research and diagnostic tests .
we once again call for a specific directive on disability to be drawn up , based on article 13 of the treaty , and for the un convention in this area to be ratified and signed .
we wanted to make the european project more complete , to give it its due scope .
however , to do so , we must prove that they are indeed effective .
i am also and above all opposed to these amendments because they totally disregard the concerns of patients .
the strategy for africa proposed by the commission and the effort proposed by the british presidency could respond to the need to react in the face of an issue about which the only clear thing is that we are facing a european problem for which that very european dimension is the only solution , the union dimension , combined with that of the member states .
what is to blame ?
i do not need to remind you here of the importance of these lines as the new treaty is being put to the people of europe .
unfortunately , the baltic is the most polluted area of marine water in the world .
i do not think so .
nevertheless , this demand is being met with deaf ears , an autistic response , and even no response at all .
however , the implementation of such a tax is not justified in romania .
nor is there any mention by name of those interests that are squeezing dry the rural , regional economy and mining the balanced relationship between the countryside and the town , creating ever greater waves of unemployed who throng to urban centres to add their numbers to the already tremendous number of existing unemployed .
so let us be clear - and i repeat - us-style opt-out class actions are not on the agenda and will not be on my agenda .
( ro ) i , too , wish to stress the importance of freedom of movement as a fundamental right , and i reconfirm that numerous citizens from countries in the western balkans will enjoy this right .
this approach fully respects the subsidiarity principle .
i have to take a deep breath !
the fact that the ppe-de group and union for europe of the nations group have declared here that they can still endorse the proposal , given that the council and the required qualified majority in this house will ensure that the licensing provisions will not survive at second reading , is reason enough for the two representatives of the dutch socialist party to vote against the proposal .
national tax sovereignty is not at stake .
it has also been pointed out , though , that other dissidents are still behind bars .
i do not know what i should do , but i should like that to be recorded in the minutes .
have we the right to remain silent on algeria when we intervene all over the world ?
madam president , unfortunately , i , once again , have to request the floor to inform you and the house of another tragedy at sea .
as a matter of principle , we only negotiate ftas which are compatible with wto rules and which , building on the wto acquis , go much further in coverage than the doha round .
it concerns in total more or less 220 acts .
why is this unacceptable ?
the current transitory system is not yielding the desired results when it comes to the internal market .
i know that the commissioner , as a champion of the fight against racism and discrimination , is very well aware that a lot remains to be done at european level as well .
what matters to the european people ' s party is that the consumer has choices . this presupposes both the availability of information and the guarantee that what is on offer on the market does not present any health risks and that all products are manufactured in accordance with current rules and procedures .
the work of the slim group has led to a series of important recommendations which we are following up as a top priority within the commission 's work programme , so as to improve the operation of the vat system .
it can not be that if i want to take out ucits in another country , i will end up in a worse situation than if i did it in my own country .
so far as assistance to third countries is concerned , following a few limited common actions , in 2002 the european union adopted a common action and on that basis launched specific actions involving projects for the collection and destruction of weapons in africa , asia , latin america and the balkans .
fourthly , measures should be taken involving cooperation and technical support for third countries , in particular asian ones , in order to enable preventative and screening action to be taken in the countries in which avian influenza originates .
some of the participants in this debate , who i can no longer see here at the moment , have expressed the criticism that the reach project would reduce the level of protection for employees in the chemicals industry .
in october last year , the council asked the commission to submit its opinion .
( the president cut off the speaker )
in the meantime , commissioner , i invite you to discover one of these little rosés from gaillac , with a thousand colours of the tarn , to be enjoyed responsibly , of course .

i believe that it is both proper and fitting to set up a centre for monitoring this coherence between community policies and development and cooperation policy , and that this monitoring centre ' s sphere of activity should not be limited just to community policies , but should also cover member states ' actions and policies , including the actions of economic groups , which i think are also important .
what we do propose is the minimum essential degree of harmonisation , which should certainly go beyond the level that is set in the proposed directive for the protection of the community ' s financial interests and should therefore cover a wider catalogue of crimes than is covered by the 1995 convention .

at the same time , however , the objectives and the substance of the cooperation , which these institutions are there to implement , are tending to weaken , degenerate , be trivialised , break apart and dissolve , to the point where , soon – if we let this carry on – they will consist only of financial aid with an upper limit and of standard free trade agreements that could be more a source of difficulty for the acp countries than real instruments to aid their development .

it was a historic moment .

however , it is widely recognised that these controls are carried out differently in the different member states .
the directive on food supplements is designed to harmonise the laws of the member states .
yes , it does exist .
that being so , although we want progress in china , we should wait before it is achieved , and so it would send completely the wrong message if the embargo were to be lifted at the present time .
in this context of wholesale change , and in order to prevent our nation states vanishing again , in the wake of globalisation which is creating hitherto unprecedented scales and challenges , europe needs to be economically strong , because globalisation demands unity , because every day we hear news of new agreements at world level and news of changes at european level too .
overcoming these obstacles is without doubt a major achievement , and one on which bosnia and herzegovina are very much to be congratulated .
and many regional governments , like the government in wales , have been leading the way in adopting radical policies to combat climate change .
in a few weeks ' time the commission will present its opinion on the candidate states .
the 2004 annual report issued by the european ombudsman reveals that the number of complaints received increased by 53 % in 2004 compared to 2003 .

agenda 2000
consequently i am somewhat encouraged , as i imagine the presidency is too , by the apparent initiative of the french president , who spoke to the russian president with a view to a meeting of the contact group next week in new york to discuss the possibility of a security council resolution on the situation in kosovo . the aim of this is doubtless to look again at whether tougher measures can be taken to force a cessation of hostilities .
i think that the initial experiences show that it is useful to have such a dialogue . it means that the budget will be reviewed in detail by those who are politically responsible , and that the committee on budgets is properly involved .
therefore , the commission , which received a considerable number of complaints , as you know , had to do its job , which means it had to investigate these complaints .
they are then allowed to replace this trawler with a new one on the same licence , so they get two trawlers full for the price of one .

we hope that the restrictions imposed on romanian and bulgarian workers concerning the access to the community labour market will be removed .
as we know , only one member state does this reasonably adequately at present ; the others have to date refused to .
i believe that this will fulfil a very important cultural brief , whereby the economy is perhaps only left standing temporarily .

madam president , ladies and gentlemen , it appears that the commission 's aim in this document is not really to protect human beings from an information society which can be devastating in terms of people 's private lives - as vaguely hinted in the text - but also for the individual who is turned into a labour commodity in the name of this concept which is becoming a ubiquitous one in community documents : competition .
the council , which is not represented here today , has taken months to revise and reconsider the proposals presented by the commission and to come up with a solution in a situation where we have huge , rising unemployment .
are we moving towards a situation where the entire territory will be divided into zones ?

what we are going to vote on , today , is the result of a compromise - sometimes a difficult compromise - and i do understand that mr lamassoure and the other rapporteurs have achieved , on our behalf , a result which is practicable and feasible .
that was one reason for reorientating phare towards the two major areas of infrastructure and institutions and also increasing the critical size of the programmes .

a clear example of misinformation .
the second is to maintain and guarantee the independence of cooperative and regional banks , which , with their 'one person , one vote ' and maximum shareholdings , are a bulwark of the real economy .

the proposal to establish the european diplomatic service is a leap forward when compared with what is strictly provided for by the treaties .
thirdly , there is the problem of access to democracy , the rule of law and peace , at local level as well as at global level . are we prepared to make our international bodies democratic , to support democrats in africa , at the risk of losing a part of that excessive power that the north has over the planet , powers symbolised by the g8 who are now shut away , as if in a fortress , at gleneagles ?

this discussion must produce concrete results : the monitoring of action by the member states , the monitoring of local action and the monitoring of the living conditions of roma citizens .
i refer to a community region , european politically speaking but african geographically speaking , which is called the canary islands and is situated on the atlantic flank opposite morocco .
some of us , in both political and normal life , have experienced failure , and this has now happened to the champions of the european constitution .
consequently , greater integration and better coordination of economic policies is required , and the work of the institutions forming the emerging economic government of the union must be developed .
mr president , i wrote to you on 16 and 23 march of this year in my capacity as chairman of the ind/dem group office , concerning the so-called reconstruction of the independence and democracy group of which the parliament authorities were informed by the group’s leadership during the last plenary session .
this is not just parliamentary talk .
of particular importance , in my view , is the drafting of a method for establishing minimum distances .
the report is important for development of contacts between the eu and third countries .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m .
but in the meantime we must make what we do in terms of humanitarian aid more effective .
how does it help the victims if they have to be afraid that the work that they are doing at that point in time is being criminalised still further ?
. – mr alavanos , what you have just said is absolutely right .
it was an involuntary omission .
in my view , this was long overdue , because the decision to move from a purely economic community to political union was taken a long time ago .
this concept must therefore be introduced .
i believe that the minimum compensation guidelines set out by the committee for unacceptable delays are broadly correct .
europe can not afford to miss out on the benefits biotechnology will bring .
how can we fail to see that the united states is trying , by means of the oecd , to take back with one hand what they have given to the gatt with the other , and to undermine our social and environmental framework in their quest for absolute liberalism .

if we want to make eu 2020 a reality , the member states will have to step up implementation of the services directive .
mr clark , it is hard to see how exactly this connects with the present debate on the oral question , but thank you .

that is why it is gratifying that we can present this example at the end of the swedish presidency .
the convention will discuss measures which will lead to a modification of the treaties in 2004 .
this latest report and discussion is just one in a long line indicating that the security forces are not acting as they should and that the causes are not being investigated .
i intend to continue my political work .
we refer to the risks to public health ( allergies , increased resistance to antibiotics , possible toxicity ) , and , in more general terms , to the ecosystems in which gmos are released ( threat to biodiversity etc . ) .
it is vital for these accompanying institutional measures to be retained .
the council is choosing to take account of this and i find it very difficult to see it as a commitment of any value .
there is a need for its scope to be broadened , and indeed there is a need for greater transparency and accessibility of information in relation to , in particular , the annual reports and the denial notifications .
unfortunately there were various points in this report , various lines of argument , which i was not able to support .
mr president , everyone knows that my group still has one or two problems with the rocard report , so i was extremely surprised to hear what mr vandemeulebroucke just said about us not keeping to our agreements .
we should therefore support the implementation of the djibouti peace agreement , since without peace , stability , improved security and responsible government we will hear more often of tragedies such as aisha 's death .
by contrast , the foreign policy of the spanish government has set a good example , as through constructive , exacting dialogue , a considerable number of prisoners of conscience have been released .
the research and training networks should also be continued , particularly the flexible support they have given under fp5 and fp6 to a positive mix of both ‘early-stage researchers’ and ‘experienced researchers’ .
recently , the members of the foro de ermua [ ermua forum ] visited us and i would like to remind the house that these members come from all sections of the political spectrum , ranging from left to right . they are intellectuals , they are men and women who live in the basque country and who can not exercise their rights , their right to freedom of expression , because they constantly feel under pressure from herri batasuna , the political wing of eta .
unfortunately , the conservative majority did not follow the recommendations of the social democrats on this issue .
it is ironic that we are so proud of our unity and solidarity , but at the same time the president of the union seems to pick favourites with regard to the most important current issue .
on behalf of the gue/ngl group . - ( it ) mr president , mr tajani , ladies and gentlemen , it really seems as though the thousands of deaths already caused by asbestos , and the tens of thousands of people at risk of dying in the coming years due to progressive exposure to asbestos - the latency period , we know , can be up to 15 or even 20 years - count for nothing at all .
i am therefore very pleased with this step which , although small , is of great significance to small business , providing clarity on payment periods .
i wish to give the commission 's response , starting with the programme on injury prevention .
the next item is the report ( a4-0231/96 ) by mr schiedermeier , on behalf of the committee on social affairs and employment , on the communication from the commission to the council and european parliament on a european strategy for encouraging local development and employment initiatives ( com ( 95 ) 0273 - c40289/95 ) .
this supplementary factor becomes clear in the relevant co-financing of the member states .
early next year the european council is to decide which countries are to participate in the european currency .
however , on the whole , we should be pleased that we have reached this point .
i ask that the - possibly amended - motion for a resolution be approved on thursday .

the symbolism is crystal clear .
the need for reform has been recognized for some years , but so has the impossibility of carrying out such reform .
– ‘european citizenship’ is an ideological construct of no practical value , given that citizenship is granted by the member states .
in future , the computer-related content of jobs is going to be increasingly marked , but we have a lack of workers qualified in this area , as do the united states .
there is some justification for this , but it has meant neglecting smaller local government structures at a lower level , even though they were in even greater need of support .
we do agree that it is good to look at whether we can initiate dialogue with the belarusian authorities on an informal basis , as has also been proposed by the french presidency , on a possible follow-up .
what conclusion can be reached ?
as you never fail to mention competition in the same breath as words like ‘harmful’ and ‘dumping’ , are you afraid of it ?
mr president , i am asking that the second part of paragraph 10 contain the following : ‘and requests that any such future action contribute to bringing to an end discrimination based on sex or caste , wherever it takes place’ .
the threat of terrorist attacks , which is still very real , points to the need to strengthen european security standards .
could i advise the council to deduct the member states’ own resources from their net payments ?
the thomas report merely proposes a common forestry strategy based on greater co-ordination of national policies and the strengthening of protection , training and information measures .
this should come as no surprise , as the virus of freedom and democracy is extremely contagious and fast-spreading .
they also debated the need for further action to continue the fight against climate change .
europe just looks on , while their school books still teach turkish children that the armenian genocide is a fabrication of history .
i can inform the house that we are willing to accept either wholly or in part 17 of the amendments ; 14 can be accepted in full .
this will require immediate financial support , since any funds generated by emission trading after 2013 will arrive too late .
that is clear .
i agree with your approach to côte d'ivoire , mr president .
of course it was only a small-scale conflict .
this opens up a market of nearly 600 million consumers to the european union entrepreneur .
instead of finally learning a lesson from that , we keep hearing about the reasons why we have to have all this and everyone says it is urgently necessary , yet we do not act accordingly .
mr president , mr president-in-office of the council , ladies and gentlemen , i have risen to speak as a representative of the largest of the new member states , poland , in this debate involving questions to the council on the 2007-2013 financial perspective .
i am pleased therefore that the european parliament is asking for a proposal on the heating and cooling sectors to be central to the future framework directive on renewable energies and i therefore voted in favour of the thomsen report .
let us set our course for that objective .
for this reason , we should begin with voluntary commitments , ideally adopting a transatlantic approach - because we simply can not regulate the internet in the absence of common global initiatives - and if the voluntary commitments prove inadequate , we shall then have to discuss legal measures too .
in addition , the issue concerns an atypical form of work , which is why it is appropriate for us to adopt a directive establishing minimum requirements , especially bearing in mind enlargement .
it is clear that in order to achieve these objectives , it is necessary to adopt reforms without delay , so that people seeking asylum in eu member states are provided with effective protection .
secondly , i believe we agree that we must speed up the creation of a palestinian state , and i refer to the resolutions which began in 1948 , at the time of the creation of the state of israel .
at that time , all but six of the labour members signed a resolution condemning the military action in the gulf .
you asked whether or not the european parliament would participate as an observer during the referendum , as it usually does . in principle , this issue will have to be resolved by the council of ministers , which will determine how we should participate under the framework of the united nations and with respect for the terms of the agreement between indonesia and portugal .
common values and social justice will play a central role in allaying such fears .
this is a report which has to draw on the human rights concepts embodied in the relevant un declarations , the international covenant on economic , social and cultural rights , the un convention on the rights of the child , and lastly the whole body of non-discrimination legislation of the european union itself : everything , that is , which the helsinki final act and the charter of paris refer to as the 'human dimension ' .
there will be a billion for strengthening the eu’s external aspects , and an extra billion will really stiffen the sinews of the common foreign and security policy .
the group of the greens/european free alliance estimates that it would be difficult to significantly raise the taxes paid by small businesses , which create the majority of jobs .
the aim of any policy can only be rich and diverse life .
you said you were going to harmonise sanctions .
these two facts alone mean that the level of spending proposed in the budget should be as high as possible .
so when we talk about regional cooperation , we must be very , very careful that this is not interpreted as giving encouragement to those who would like nothing better than to destroy bosnia-herzegovina altogether .
i sincerely hope that the meeting between the amu heads of state will enable progress to be made in this area .
we would like to establish four major areas of support .
now i come from a country that sets great store by the expression : 'not words but deeds ' and you will soon have this opportunity .
as a former member of the european parliament , i have always been proud of the strong record of this house in advocating respect for human rights and related international obligations , as well as in supporting the multilateral system based on the united nations .
i hope that both the commission and the council can support this so that we will at least have an alternative ready in a few years ' time .
in particular , minimum standards should be applied in social and environmental matters .
we must persist in our efforts , for it is the people of the middle east who are at stake .
it should not be a matter of which committee of experts is more expert than the other . it should be a matter of broad public consultation and debate in order to establish consensus in our societies as to the future direction and application of new reproductive technologies .
thank you , commissioner .
misusers must be given treatment , but use must be punished .
corrections to votes and voting intentions : see minutes
the commission is in the process of evaluating the report by the european parliament on its communication on a common procedure in order to present , before the end of this year , a legislative initiative on a common procedure for asylum in europe .
press agencies report that the islamic military police shot two people and wounded four others during the germany-italy match .
parliament is being threatened with ...
it is incumbent on us in europe to bring the us along in order to take further and stronger action .
mr president , i should like to use this brief contribution to say a few words of appreciation for the lagendijk report .
we abhor the fact that it is particularly the pharmaceutical multinationals that will gain through this inhumane policy , by maintaining their fabulous profits at the cost of many lives .
this was done once before , in 1998 , and the policy measures were clearly defined in the report .
we had an opportunity to strengthen the pact , with automatic penalties , in particular , but what happens ?
i am therefore asking you to be particularly vigilant to ensure that our rights , which are increasingly threatened , remain the only things that govern our policies .
nevertheless , there are a number of issues where we have slight differences of views .
payment appropriations for actions against anti-personnel mines are down by 1.5 % .
in the budgetary review , we propose fixed margins which are bigger at the end of the financial perspective , and also to establish performance-oriented reserves .
we still need to invest considerably in research and product development if we are to increase the share of renewable energy .
i would like to finish by expressing my sincere thanks once again to all my fellow members for their outstanding cooperation .
action is particularly essential in light of the fact that these fish live a long time , grow slowly and have low reproductive capacity .
but it would be neither right nor a good idea to shorten that debate since the italian president-in-office of the council will be here on wednesday morning .
access to the internet , special attention to ict and education all over the world , on-line government and truly participatory democracy are crucial .
that did not happen in the past .
we are aware of the contribution that some of these guidelines may make towards appreciably and temporarily improving the workings of the financial system .
the primary merit of the dehaene report lies in establishing what is at stake and giving a real political perspective to institutional reform .
a state is a tool for all the citizens .
in fact , it will probably become hardly worth fishermen putting to sea in many parts of the european union 's waters .
the rejection of the eu 's 'one china policy ' , the demands for a dialogue 'without preconditions ' made it impossible for me to support the resolution even with my agreement on the human rights elements contained within the resolution , as i indicated by my roll-call votes .
i have no evidence at all to support this , and i would certainly not have thought that the austrian authorities would do anything to prevent refugees from returning home .
this is important for newcomers , but mainly to lessen the 'windfall profits ' that are so prominent in the electricity sector .
moreover , one line for administrative expenses has been created for each programme and the amounts for the various key measures will be entered in the remarks .
even certain member states at the forefront of the demands for me to adopt emergency and urgent procedure have not sent me the facts on which i could base such urgent action .
the commission needs to focus properly on these two elements in the action plan , and the member states need to give their full support to installing the infrastructure needed to make it happen , if necessary , through public procurement contracts .
the second challenge is this : there will be repercussions .
the confederal group of the european united left was of the opinion that the 1995 conciliation report sacrificed these factors on the altar of the economy and of profit , and for this reason we voted against it and helped ensure that it did not succeed .
i would like to say today to our new colleagues that we eagerly await their contributions to our debates , and we wish them every success in their parliamentary work .
we are reforming our institutions and economy to bring greater prosperity and stability to our people and our region .
i think there is a need to consolidate the financial situation and to devise measures to promote growth .
in short , it must be possible to adjust programmes after they have started and in a flexible manner ; that is a requirement we should set out in relation to the reform .
there is talk of a special fund created from a surcharge on air tickets , and also of bankruptcy insurance .
the issue at stake is that the council reached an agreement today .
our conclusion should be clear : the russian parliament has distanced itself from all democratic parliaments in the world and has also proved that the last dictator in europe has the full backing of the russian duma , controlled by political forces closely linked to president putin .
this is a problem linked to the construction of europe , in transition between nation states and a federation .
, in writing - ( cs ) in my opinion , the aviation agreement with canada is a fundamental commercial instrument which will deliver benefits to both sides , but in view of the discrimination against czech citizens and the position of mps from the chamber of deputies of the parliament of the czech republic , i am abstaining from the vote .
i would therefore like us to vote against amendment 5 , which seeks to remove the text 'ensure that the expression of controversial political beliefs through the internet is not subject to criminal prosecution ' .
it is just as wrong to execute saddam hussein and timothy mcveigh , the oklahoma bomber , as ken sara-wiwo , the nigerian human rights activist , or the hundreds of victims of saddam hussein 's brutal , totalitarian regime .
in writing . - ( da ) we have voted against the report on the application of the residence directive .
at this juncture we find that the pressures which had a negative influence on discussion of the report have been considerably aggravated by the imminence of the elections .
concerning russia , there are very few fake products seized by eu customs that have come from russia .
mr president , the european union is finally realising that there are serious social problems underlying the tragic situation in columbia , specifically the need for the fair redistribution of wealth and land between the few who have everything and the many who have nothing .
the structure and provision of healthcare is a national matter , but in the case of an epidemic or a pandemic , we need to work together at european level .
the present arrangement concerning customs security measures will be added to the 1990 agreement under the form of a new title iia and , unlike the customs union , will apply to agricultural products .
we can not sacrifice human rights and the rights of minorities for the sake of cooperation with moscow .
there has , therefore , been no cooperation , coordination or consistency whatsoever in the application of eu legislation .
mr president , i should like to congratulate mr bourlanges on this own-initiative report , which makes very interesting , though sometimes quite demanding reading .
secondly , we are insisting , and i believe that this is vital , that countries which have special links in a region , for example turkey in the mediterranean area and among the turkic peoples , should become more closely involved , because we do not want to go over the heads of the people concerned , but rather to take into account their traditional structures and links .
here they are being used as a means of raising domestic policy issues .
the third aspect is the cfsp .
in writing . - ( el ) the adoption of a strategy for the danube region will be the jewel in the crown of cooperation developed between member states , local authorities , ngos , civil society organisations and other stakeholders in the area at national or regional level .
indeed , this tardiness is hindering the creation of a european railway area based on common harmonised standards , standards necessary to permit the optimum functioning of the market .
the effects of the situation , whether negative or positive , will affect the entire caucasus area .
our ambition for european integration requires us to make progress in the reforms that i have just listed .
it is not restricted to size .
i think we all agree on the importance of this proposal and of environmental economic accounts .
before concluding , i shall take the liberty of making one final point , which concerns labelling .
it is part of a more global context , that of implementing a genuine youth policy , something that the european parliament has always called for with insistence .
it is our heartfelt wish that the legacy of grace and kindness bequeathed by the princess of wales may live on .
as a janus member - half constitutional , half budgetary - i would like today to speak a little more specifically about mrs guy-quint 's report on the new budget system and about the impact that the treaty of lisbon will have on this new system .
many of us will also recall the special interest he took in matters concerning premises as a member of the specialist group of parliament 's bureau .
i can not guarantee that the system will work .
this should serve as something of a warning to parliament .
sars is a very serious problem .
for me personally , this budget has a bittersweet taste , because it includes successes , but it also has shadows .
vice-president of the commission . - ( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i am particularly grateful to the few , perhaps less than ten , members present in this chamber to debate a subject that affects many tens of millions of young and very young people - our children - in the european union .
mr president , i would like to associate myself with the remarks of other members of the house about the colleague of the lady from scotland who has just spoken .
i think that here we can see a change of mentality to which your report could contribute , but we need to go further .
i feel that protecting the environment and security of energy supplies are not mutually exclusive .
they are two important worlds for europe and for its future , that is to say , the world of small and medium-sized enterprises and the world of young people .
quality of service and the safety of operations are part and parcel of all these services .
both harbour a dangerous illusion , for there can be only one europe , truly european .
if not , please slow down slightly .
the third freedom , of the provision of services , is also at risk .
halting deforestation is one of the ways that we should be tackling climate change , and governments around the globe have been trying to do this for years .
in all events , we do not need divisions , we do not need new iron curtains , we do not need new cold war fronts .
the european structural funds play a major role in this process .
– mr president , we can accept the changes in substance , despite the restricted emphasis on some details .
it is just that it is not as noticeable in the figures because there are not as many of them in the member states .
so in parallel with the implementation of processes to promote literacy and education in general , we must also engage in some collective thinking about the living conditions of children in the various countries , especially in urban areas , and assist in projects to look after street children in third world countries , and also in our own countries , developing pilot schemes inspired , for example , by the family pre-school proposed by atd quart-monde .
after the serbian reign of terror , with all the murder , fire , and ethnic cleansing that entailed , these people are now left with the fear as to what has become of what are literally many thousands of missing persons and prisoners .
our proposal on the resumption of rail services to nikšić on the bosnian border and to shkodër in albania has also been adopted .
it could even be seen as a model of interinstitutional co-operation .
it has been absent from discussions with the committees looking at the proposed budget .
i receive many complaints from people with reduced mobility who find it very difficult to travel by rail across europe .
we also need to present and implement a set of policies to keep and motivate older workers to stay in the job market .
it is partly because of this that consumers are afraid to use foreign service providers .
i am convinced that the public will be watching us carefully when we vote tomorrow , as there is a real demand for measures to be taken on this issue .
the bone of contention is the composition of the diplomatic service , and the available information indicates that the role of the new member states in the selection of this team has been disregarded , to put it mildly .
having said that , we who carry political responsibility are involved , we have a particular responsibility because this accident has highlighted a number of questions that can not be avoided .
at the same time , it will encourage special interventions to reduce differentials between women and men , financed from existing allocations , and on an appropriately large scale .
we should be under no illusion that in time co-financing of the cap will inevitably lead to its renationalisation .
however , this should not mean that businesses are exempted from their social and territorial obligations .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i too would like to preface what i have to say with a few words of gratitude addressed to both rapporteurs , mr fava and mrs sanders-ten holte , taking as i do the view that both reports have been drafted with great care and have also demonstrated a very responsible approach to their subject-matter .
sometimes we should give russia , our important partner , credit for that and not allow ourselves to be carried away solely by the emotions aroused by our own history .
above all , we are pleased that the activities of the european parliament have also been included in the report on human rights .
that would be as absurd as making a café owner liable for monitoring what is said across the café tables .
however , we have spared no effort over the last years to support the peace processes at work in the great lakes region .
i have no problem burdening industry where there are real advantages to improving environmental standards , but such perverse decisions like today 's only threatens support for future environmental legislation and public support .
the european union is the world 's largest donor of humanitarian aid .
that is why we decided in the committee even before the summer break that we would enter into detailed consultations now in the first reading , complete the normal procedure of first and second readings and then await the council 's common position .
obviously , we will be dealing with the four issues that were mentioned by the european council including one issue which overlaps very much with the commission 's white paper on governance .
well , all the signs are that the famous berlin declaration , in the spirit of its initiators , opts for the latter , starting with the method used to draft it : where there should have been a consultation that was largely open to the citizens , it was decided that leaders would debate more or less behind closed doors .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
but between 1985 and the present day , we also had the crisis over bse .
the common position strengthens and clarifies the original commission proposal designed to deal with this matter .
these are pivotal issues for the future of the european union and of the cohesion policy , and that is why this subject , which we are now discussing at the midnight hour , is more important than has been evident hitherto .
nevertheless , we have presented some amendments to our rapporteur 's compromise , for which we congratulate her .
what are the objectives ?
the member states are doing things here that they would not dare do at home .
looking at some of the press reports of last friday , i believe that the commission and its president exercised commendable self-restraint in the way they commented publicly .
we looked into that last year , as you will remember , in relation to violent video games ; a statistical survey in europe showed that only 20 % of respondents were interested in how their children used the internet and came across or used video games . that means that 80 % of parents surveyed were not aware what type of electronic games or internet sites their children were visiting .
these countries , which joined the european union in 2007 , adopted only some of the provisions concerning the schengen area , and have applied them within this limited scope ever since .
the declared aim of this eighth directive is to harmonize the period of the application of summer-time . i subscribe to that .
during the debate on this subject yesterday , some of the speakers were talking nonsense .
surely that is not too much to ask ?
i would like to propose to you that the national parliaments should also be added to the list of those bodies that possess the right of action in the ecj .
it is therefore important for the eu to tackle this problem by defining joint preventive actions to prohibit the practice of mutilation in the eu and by referring to this prohibition in all cooperation agreements concluded with third countries .
we extend a warm welcome to him , and hope that he will be able to take back many ideas from parliament to his country .
in addition , the human rights situation in this country remains more than critical .
the treaty itself stipulates it : we meet every fortnight and , every fortnight , we invite the president of the euro group .
but i can assure him that he could have got many cheap copies among those that were pirated in asia over the last three or four years .
the debate is closed .
despite these difficulties , however , let me say that for the first time since the second world war , europe now has the opportunity to take on political leadership at world level .
question time with mrs reding began at 20:00 .
this is directly linked with the target agreed by the member states in 2005 : 25 % of senior posts in public research organisations should be occupied by women .
mr president , i just want clarification .
so by your amendments , mrs palacio vallelersundi , for which i thank you , you have consolidated and made explicit the legal base which the commission proposed .
i also think more use needs to be made of the opportunities afforded by schools , which would , if appropriate , involve modifying curricula .
although it is certainly to soon to pass judgment on how the convention is working in practice , there has already been a feeling for some time that a legal instrument is needed to support the implementation of the convention by providing for fingerprints to be taken from asylum-seekers so that these prints can be compared by a central office .
the proposal for harmonisation is , of course , heading in the right direction , since it is seeking to halt the downward spiral in the conditions in which asylum applicants are received in europe .
i reiterate and stress that the commission shares the anger of consumers .
the european project will only be viable if we are able to ensure that disadvantaged groups in society are able to exercise their rights .
article 130s , on the environment , is undoubtedly very important , and this is also an environmental issue , but i think that in this case we should put more emphasis on consumer protection .
yet , this 'no ' vote casts major doubts over the timetable for ratification , and perhaps even as to whether ratification will be achieved .
the corollary of this observation on the new circumstances , however , is the need to guarantee the utmost transparency and efficacy of the appropriate safety standards in all installations in the european union .
recognising the right to education is certainly one way of combating child labour , but it is not the only one : there is also the first millennium goal , namely poverty eradication in general , which is a decisive factor in the fight against child labour and increasing the number of young people attending school .
only thus , with a new form of governance on a world-wide scale , with greater participation and transparency , with practical decisions and measures , will we be able to combat hunger and poverty and win this challenge , the greatest challenge facing mankind .
at present , however , money for climate policy comes mainly from development-policy funds , and that is unacceptable .
i think that at least one commissioner could have represented you at durban .
there are real security-of-supply issues that need to be addressed very quickly .
thirdly , the commission has tried to ensure that , in the very short term , the member states exposed to the growing flows of refugees and irregular migrants could cope with the financial consequences of this displacement .
i am referring to rule 72 , not to the sentence that you referred to , but to rule 72 , 2c .
what are consumers supposed to make of such information ?
but we need to persuade asean to change its policy towards burma .
now he has stayed in durban , which i do not want to criticise in itself , but i would like to say that the council must be reformed ,
this stipulation of the rules of procedure is certainly imperative for the european parliament , but not for a properly appointed commissioner .
i thought it appropriate to retable at second reading three of the 12 amendments rejected by the council .
as regards the field of transport in general , it must be emphasised that community financial aid in the field of the trans-european transport networks is intended for cofinancing projects that are often carried out within the framework of cooperation between national , public and also private authorities in the member states .
by participating in the emcdda and exchanging information , croatia will be able to understand the problem and better respond to it .
my question referred to a referendum on the establishment of democracy .
the decision taken in the european parliament will combine the registers of lobbyists and interest groups currently kept separately by the two abovementioned institutions .
i should add that applicant countries can join in and that is provided for .
mr president , i too appreciate greatly that the greek presidency has taken an enlightened approach to facilitating legal migration and integration , not just fighting illegal immigration .
well , plan a , which is aarhus , is surely a framework for ensuring that we can have dialogue , debate and democracy in environmental matters .
until about 15 years ago half of europe did not enjoy freedom and democracy .
and we must urge our member states to gather as much support as possible here , because we have russia , ukraine , brazil and chile , for example , and we have to steer the same course as the united states too .
there is room for all professions concerned with the law and the administration of justice - such as lawyers , public prosecutors and police officers in the united kingdom - to play their appropriate parts .
madam president , i am afraid that mr barrot 's statement has not reassured me at all .
even its smallest movements were likely to keep you awake at night .
personally , i agree with the representatives of industry that the brussels regulations on the introduction of electric vehicles are a death-knell .
secondly , the point was several times made in the debate - although the appropriate amendments were eventually rejected - that the poor and marginalized are in some sense the opponents of those who are integrated into society , have jobs , are organized in trade unions and are relatively well paid .
firstly , the geographical extension of this agreement , with the entry of significant players , such as china and the developing countries , and , secondly , the need to ensure fair , balanced and reciprocal conditions for the companies of the different countries .
mr president , i ask for linguistic correction because the resolution was negotiated in the french language .
the objective must be to put a complete stop to the discharges of persistent organic pollutants by banning their production , use and import .
a further reason for the delay , which is not so easy to remedy , is that this analysis remains a delicate and somewhat controversial subject between the various services of the commission , which have expressed significantly divergent opinions on the best way to proceed .
what we are doing is treating the symptoms .
. – mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the lisbon european council of 2000 marks an important turning-point for european politics in general and for research and the knowledge-based society in particular .
by means of the second and subsequent framework programmes for research and technological development , and through the activities of the joint research centre , the community is making a major contribution towards the prevention of serious accidents .
already two new investment projects at tilbury have been put on hold because of the uncertainty created by this directive .
this group will assist the commission in outlining new steps for the media landscape .
farmers must remain in charge of their own affairs , and the manufacturers ' monopoly must not prevent them from doing their job , especially since , in the event of a crisis , they will be blamed for misusing feedingstuffs that they know nothing about .
questions must also be asked as to the dissociation implemented over the current scheduling period between rural development and regional policy .
in conclusion , because i do not want to prolong the debate on this point , i am anxious , mr president , to thank you and thank the parliament for its suggestion , which opens a first track for the application of article 103 a , paragraph 2 once the third phase on economic and monetary union has come into effect .
some members of the ipcc now even predict global cooling .
on the contrary , the macroeconomic reality is the opposite .
what mr miranda says is correct , but it is misleading to say that is an amendment .
indeed , in my view , it is not enough to revise the rules for implementing the pact .
i also believe , although i will no doubt come back to this point later on during the debate on the european union policy and the debate on budgetary aid , that it would be advisable to open negotiations with the governments on sectoral aid .
the regulatory framework of the telecommunications sector comprises numerous directives , each covering its respective aspects .
i extend these congratulations , of course , to the chairmen of our committee , mr fazakas and mr bösch .
al qaida sleeper networks still remain in 52 countries .
given their isolation , special measures need to be taken to improve connections with island areas .
so , while we currently have very few data , the aim is to provide ourselves with the better statistics that the honourable member is looking for .
you now say that the choice of words `` has condemned ' and in article 1 `` condemned the murder ' , etcetera , does not fit the facts .
our parliament has amended the services directive .
service providers must inform air crews about the areas at high risk of ash contamination .
we should talk about what we have in common !
whilst observing the maastricht criteria , these countries are shamelessly running up their budget deficits in order to help those same employers who remain extremely determined to maintain , or even increase , their profits in a period of stagnation .
mr president , i , too , support mrs baldi 's report because , like her , i feel the acp joint assembly continues to be a very important parliamentary instrument linking the northern and southern hemispheres .
i hope that we will remain ambitious , and not scale back our ambitions too much , but still speak with one voice .
pluralism is essential in the information society , but not in a form which consists of two speeds , one being direct control by the pse and the ppe , and the other being a vague monthly report on the body 's activities , intended for the other political groups .
there is no point pretending that you are unaware of these things , ladies and gentlemen .
as the amsterdam treaty requires new rules on public access , the rules on access to documents in competition cases should also be clarified .
accordingly , it is also sensible to form a common vision about the consequences of our energy policies on investments , energy prices and regulation .
i have to say that the union ' s own generalised preference system is an excellent tool .
however , the experiences and the mistakes made in the union for the mediterranean , where the aim was to achieve a state of security by supporting despotic regimes , show that we must rely on forces other than corrupt governments .
the risk remains that enlargement will be restricted to just a few countries .
i offer three reinforcements to the points made in the report .
why is that ?
( de ) madam president , ladies and gentlemen , this revision of the design directive revolves around the question of whether or not the protection that is rightly afforded to the design of car bodies should be extended to matching visible spare parts , such as wing mirrors and headlights .
surely saddam hussein 's violations of the rights of the kurds whom he has gassed , the marsh arabs and the shias whom he has tortured and killed , and the israelis , where he has paid the families of suicide bombers to kill innocent victims , are much worse than any of milosevic 's crimes , - not to mention the british and the americans whom he has sworn revenge against for our participation in the gulf war .
nevertheless , if it wanted to , the eu could do so much more to improve the situation for christians and to promote freedom of religion in the world , for example , by insisting on a freedom of religion clause in all agreements concluded with third countries .
mr president , madam president-in-office of the council , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i will first address a word of thanks to you , commissioner , for your lucid words and your declaration that , in the context of economic and social cohesion , both the new problems of the candidates for accession and the continuing problems of the present 15 member states are being appropriately taken into account in various regions .
in the malthusian economy , the 'euthanazi state ' , the 'precautionary principle ' and the ultimate penalty of execution are the bedfellows of pride and complacency .
the success of the stability and growth pact is also reflected in the percentage decrease in total indebtedness and in the annual amount of new debt .
nevertheless , the current situation is not an entirely happy one for us , since it seems that a multilevel membership is emerging within the union , which we consider unacceptable .
but , more particularly , we must not allow it because we are representing here the european citizens ; citizens who are sitting here today and who , i imagine , will take away a very confused idea of the progress we are currently making as regards the third pillar .
madam president , 2 june 2011 marked the start of the historic tallinn-monte carlo electric car marathon , and today the cars will be reaching copenhagen .
for the rest , however , as he himself has said , the subject of tobacco as dealt with in this specific proposal for a council regulation is a purely technical matter concerning the 2002 , 2003 and 2004 crops .
for example , if a minister goes down on his knees , cut his wrists and writes a pledge in letters of blood that he will deliver the habitats directive in full within an agreed timetable , is she prepared to assist the region and provide structural funding in such circumstances ?
nobody has yet proposed a serious funding plan for natura 2000 .
in my view , victim protection is especially important .
the consequences of tolerating extreme statements and of incitement are already very much felt .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the aim of the international convention on standards of training , certification and watch keeping for seafarers - the stcw convention , as revised in 1995 - is to bring the training of seafarers more into line with the real conditions of sea transport , in particular the new technological developments on board vessels and modern methods of vocational training .
on the contrary , it appears today that relations have been weakened .
madam president , my group supports mr bonde ' s proposal for deferment , although this agreement undeniably contains some very worthwhile improvements to parliament ' s rights regarding , for example , talks on international agreements and its participation in the intergovernmental conference .
sadly , no country in the balkans has done so much .
the ambitious programme of reform for the twenty-first century is meeting with resistance from certain sectors and a number of member states .
but i can tell you that it is a good idea and that there are perhaps more arguments in favour of it now than there were at that earlier time .
whilst it is the foremost commercial power in the world , europe has so far failed to acquire the political weight to match its economic importance .
the treaties state that 12 sessions per year are to be held in strasbourg .
the european union election observation mission was present at the actual location and was led by mr lambsdorff .
that is why i think we should adhere to this position .
i also clearly heard mr gauzès 's recommendation , which was both non-committal and clear .
but i also note that any such enhancement should be agreed upon at the level of the international community and , in particular , on the basis of an appropriate transatlantic discussion .
this right must take precedence over the right of persons of the same sex to adopt a child .
indeed , we feel that the commission should present the plan at the same time as it presents the request to the budget authority and should , moreover , present the information as far as possible on a case-by-case basis .
responsibility and decisiveness are needed to ensure adequate funding for this major climate change development plan and new dynamic development agreements over and above and separately from restrictive trade agreements .
i get the impression that the group of the european people 's party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats is still living in the past .
my real wish is to take no part in this process , because i think the whole way in which the issue of allowances has been addressed shows contempt for the european parliament !
it is a fact .
does the council not consider it important to encourage diversed european film production ?
