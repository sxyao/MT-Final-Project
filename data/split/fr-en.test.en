for all of these reasons , i would ask you to provide the final impetus and to see what has been achieved as very important ; and not to take any backward steps or allow any shortcuts that dilute the content of this report .
of course we can .
strangely , in fact , the member states which do not grow tobacco but which have not banned smoking would receive sums benefiting their northern european style of agriculture , which is already sufficiently subsidised , and , what is more , they would hypocritically continue to rake in millions of euro in taxes and excise duties on tobacco products and accessories .
however , i would like it to be really clear that the proposal which we are examining is not limited to the transitional provisions but relates to the entire sixth vat directive , which specifically includes these provisions .
firstly , we take the view that any banking supervision law must , in the final analysis , serve to protect creditors , by which is meant savers , and ensure the functioning of the financial market , and , secondly , as we in the eu are endeavouring to create an internal market for financial services , transposition should be by means of a directive that leaves room for special rules at the national level only when , in really objective terms , there are special circumstances .
of course , we need to insist on the use of organic products in the scheme , and to ensure that it is effectively implemented .
that is what i wished to say .
however , what i can not understand is why we need to decide which split votes we want by 6 p.m .
mr president , the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party also wants to say that we very strongly support the initiatives you have put in place in the personnel area , mr kinnock .
the current situation is intolerable , and the proposals tabled thus far are not likely actually to solve the problem either .
we need to remove the obstacles which prevent people with disabilities from participating in economic , social and cultural life .
my willingness to support the resolution was entirely conditional on incorporation of an oral amendment extending a commitment to financial help to trade and tourism where these have been adversely affected .
in actual fact , the issue has not been resolved once and for all , and what has been done for a few categories of products , somehow containing the situation , could be required in the coming months for other categories of products .
the do√±ana national park , which was designated one of unesco 's world heritage sites , is now severely damaged .
this is not only on account of the role you played ; it is also because of the overcautiousness of its leaders , who too often prefer to stand still rather than to act .
in the final analysis , the level of success of any project will have to be measured in terms of its positive impact on eu citizens .
in this situation , should our committee not concentrate on looking for legal solutions which would prevent any such misdeeds in the future ?
( the minutes were approved )
i am from an era that was shaped by the vienna congress at the end of the napoleonic wars .
i would like at this point to state my regret and criticism regarding the fact that the union 's research policy ( and that of its member states and of the research association , eureka ) has not yet been discussed seriously as a key factor in the strategy of transition to a new development model .
for instance , we want to use joint police forces more efficiently and quickly and we want police forces from one member state that have specific skills to be able to operate in another member state .
this being so , the rapporteur has done an excellent job .
no one could , by the wildest stretch of the imagination , consider someone like emma bonino a racist .
the structure of the strategy is largely determined by the consumer and manufacturer .
control over the european programmes must be greatly improved .
it is always nice to see the british conservatives fully on board the european boat , and totally at our side .
the opinion delivered by the committee on legal affairs is characterised by bad faith and a poor interpretation of the texts .
the committee on fisheries has studied the matter and two totally different points of view have emerged .
impact of aviation security measures and body scanners on human rights , privacy , personal dignity and data protection ( debate )
( es ) mr president , i agree with your comment that this is the most appropriate way to proceed .
the spanish presidency should direct its greatest efforts towards central america , particularly at this crucial time , with the acute crisis in colombia and the collapse of the argentine economy .
it is good to see mr cohn-bendit after all these years .
according to eurostat , morocco exported over 70 000 tonnes of tomatoes in december 2010 , which is over double the quota foreseen in the agreement between the eu and morocco .
however , this should be done at national level .
a palestinian state alongside an israeli state .
at least he has revealed that , in his opinion , there were a couple of nuclear power plants that would not pass the stress tests .
( applause )
in any event , mr alavanos has the floor .
at the same time , it has to be recognised that using the riches of the arctic can open new possibilities for resolving not only energy problems , but also raw material and food-related problems .
if enlargement to the east is to be conducted in a socially responsible way , priority must be given from the outset to education and training programmes .
at the same time , a growing number of people in europe are supporting campaigns like the clean clothes campaign , promoting products that have been made under fairer conditions .
even for those countries which will not qualify for the first round of emu the process has resulted in a thorough and in many cases necessary revision of the economy .
under the present system , swedish members can make up to skr 40 000 per month tax free on travel , whereas under the present proposal , reimbursement would be on the basis of actual travel costs incurred .
there have been two major international donor conferences which have jointly raised us $ 1.8 bn .
stabilisation in this region is in the interests both of all countries in the region , and of their partners and neighbours , including european union countries .
for these reasons , we have voted against the report .
this shows that we understand nothing : we do not understand that those who migrate do not leave their country out of pleasure : they leave because they are victims of violence and poverty .
they have traditionally competed with each other with low tariffs and large public investments to secure the highest possible cargo levels for their quays .
public opinion has in fact expressed its reservations about the development of 'frankenstein foods ' on several occasions and its desire for healthy and natural food .
many thanks once again to the rapporteur . congratulations !
the commission will involve all stakeholders within the sector in a public debate that will hopefully be held in february , before presenting a proposal .
whilst the commission and parliament are demanding a substantial increase in appropriations to bring them to ecu 16.3 billion over five years , the council has given a figure of 14 billion , which in real terms represents a decrease in comparison with the fourth framework programme .
but there are areas where we also have a major public policy interest , especially in regard to universal service and data privacy .
i welcome the fact that the commission recognises the importance of consultation during the preparation of the eu strategy on the rights of the child .
as regards the body you wish to establish , do not go looking for other models .
but solidarity also means that all the member states must commit themselves fully to combating waste , corruption and mismanagement .
there was no need to admonish us to tell the truth .
does the commission have a view on what importance should be given to the role of farmers , in terms of carbon sinks , forests and other measures , when fighting one of the biggest challenges our environment faces today ?
bse has been an expensive lesson for europe and one that can not ever be repeated .
therefore , the rapporteur proposes - and the committee on the environment approved his proposal - an increase in funding from ecu 6.5 million to ecu 14 million .
this will benefit not only the european union , which has been waiting for legislation on the subject for a long time , but also and most importantly , the rightholders .
an economically prosperous lebanon would mean the return of beirut as a strong financial centre , at the expense of haifa and tel aviv .
the end of the cold war does not mean that we can continue to treat saudi arabia more leniently than iraq , or that cuba should be more strictly dealt with than colombia .
these are the projects marquis - 'methods of assessing response to quality improvement strategies ' - and simpatie - 'safety improvement for patients in europe ' .
under that legislation , security agreements have to be signed with countries that are or will be members of the visa waiver programme .
consequently , with regard to the harmonisation of accounting procedures , government reform of businesses , the organisation and the supervision of audits , of financial analysis and credit rating , we call on the european union and the commission in particular to rapidly draw up new regulatory and legislative initiatives .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , europe has always been successful when it has been ambitious .
proof of this is the fact that , a few days ago , the former president , bill clinton , was publicly criticised for failing to achieve ratification of the rome statute when he was president .
in conclusion , there is a real danger that , by seeking to amend the common position in this regard , we might jeopardise the entire single european sky project , something i am sure that we all wish to avoid .
temporary means temporary .
it calls therefore on the european commission and the member states to further develop the potential offered by the different maritime sectors by drawing up an ambitious 'blue growth ' strategy .
i agree with most of what has been brought up in the discussion , especially by the speakers immediately preceding me .
let us take an important topical example : energy policy .
as a result , the laid-off workers will be able either to get back their old jobs or find new ones , and the owners of the businesses will make use of the support to mitigate the negative effects of the global crisis and to maintain their place in the market .
madam president , our colleague , mr cox , has done some excellent work on the commission 's proposal .
by no means all the member states have yet begun to address this problem .
to quote just one example : gsm , the second generation of mobile phones .
as for food aid , i may have misunderstood the aim of the question , but at the council we have been discussing food aid primarily for developing countries , in other words the countries worst affected by the economic and financial crisis , as well as by the previous food crisis .
subject : demand for drugs to fight anthrax the anthrax crisis in the usa has produced a rise in demand for cipro , a patented drug manufactured by bayer .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to make it clear , before i say anything else , that i am not , today , speaking on behalf of the cdu/csu delegation to the european parliament . the majority of that delegation takes a different line , but i am speaking on behalf of the ppe-de group , which supports the key points of the moreira da silva report as voted in the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy .
against this background , while recognising the challenges that the npt faces , particularly on nuclear proliferation and disarmament , we believe the forthcoming third preparatory committee can be approached with some confidence .
so it is essential that intervention in future makes it possible to protect both the interests of consumers and the interests of producers , especially of small farmers .
in my view , this is sending a bad signal .
for example , i see in recital f , that the conditions for the departure of jean-bertrand aristide are criticised in a veiled manner and he is referred to as president , even though everyone knows , and the report itself recalls this in recital h , that the election to his second term in office took place without the participation of the opposition parties , which wished to protest against the vote count at the previous parliamentary elections , thus creating a crisis which has only got worse and degenerated since .
i personally , as president of this sitting , am very satisfied with your answers , with the pace at which you give your answers , and with your cooperation with parliament .
however , the need to reform the cap must not serve as an excuse for its virtual abolition .
once again , yesterday , we heard in the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy about the geneva initiative for peace in the middle east , a highly commendable initiative that should be brought into the discussion .
this eu action will therefore be able to unequivocally re-establish the necessity of responding to the needs of the real economy by supporting long-term investment and creating new additional resources to face up to and win major global and european challenges , achieving growth and development objectives under the eu 2020 strategy .
now , how can you respond to this problem of competition coming from other parts of the world which have lower standards , both in labour and in environment ?
there are technical criteria that china needs to fulfil , and it is making progress towards doing so .
the european union sent a troika mission to east timor , which was there from 26 to 30 june .
that is what was agreed .
this is the task of territorial local authorities , and strasbourg or brussels can not compensate for their failures .
( heckling : but no armchair tactics , please ! )
however , the problem is aid for production , not aid for destruction .
i do , therefore , take note of the call for the commission to consider the viability of introducing clauses for collective action on financial instruments such as securities .
the aim is to draw on research in university departments , to establish incubator companies and stimulate growth in those that are already established .
there were no legally binding commitments determining the future framework of international climate protection .
the italian renewable energy industry is thanking me today that through europe we can now also make progress with renewable energy in a country like italy .
finally , the lisbon strategy , which we voted on today , is a strategy for good governance , good economic growth and , above all , employment creation , which is the best tool for tackling poverty , social disadvantage and isolation .
‚Äì mr president , i would firstly like to praise mrs smet‚Äôs report , which i believe takes account of many of the complaints and demands from women‚Äôs organisations and human rights organisations .
mr president , i naturally support the wuori report on human rights in the european union but i feel - i am convinced - that the european union needs to do much more .
we are , however , of the view that the hiv/aids issue should not be dealt with within the framework of eu cooperation .
we neglect them at our peril and , by continuing year after year to spend less on our cultural and educational programmes than we spend on growing tobacco , we are not just neglecting them , we are turning our priorities completely upside down .
so we have a duty to take action to put an end to this discrimination .
mr president , firstly i would like to congratulate mr turmes on the report which he has prepared , as it will be of great use to the commission ' s work .
its 57 members of staff are concerned with the development of network and information security for citizens , consumers and businesses , and also for public organisations in the european union .
i would like to say that , as a newcomer to this role , i had expected sharp altercations , particularly since the report has a certain military aspect to it , but as it turned out , the work progressed very peacefully .
then we will be able to draw conclusions from this progress report .
there needs to be a fair trial without delay , with all of the guarantees necessary for her to be able to defend herself against the prosecutor 's accusations .
the report 's vision for a board of european regulators that acts as a bridge between both the commission and national regulatory authorities is one that adequately accounts for the complexity of the market and its ever-expanding nature .
the economy of the european union can not afford to neglect this potential , which is not concentrated exclusively in large centres of research but nevertheless has the critical mass to attain excellence .
this will not be possible if you do not actually provide the means to implement this policy .
madam president , commissioner , i am an elected representative of the two largest islands in the union which are not home to a european capital city - sicily and sardinia - and i must therefore express my continuing regret at the lamentable absence of any integrated community policy or specific instruments for the european island regions , confronted as they are by an extremely wide range of problems which continue to act as a permanent obstacle to their development .
that is why we also vote in favour of this report which is wholly in line with the progressive attitude the european parliament usually adopts in connection with human rights .
the targets we have set for europe for 2020 are an important milestone , but they are no more than that .
that will have to remain the responsibility of the member states .
this is mainly as a result of the resolutions passed by the heads of state and government at the berlin summit last year and these agreed financial perspectives form part of the interinstitutional agreement concluded last year between the parliament , the council and the commission .
mr president , i refer to rule 151 of the rules of the procedure , which states that the meetings of the committees are open to the public .
i believe that we can not strongly welcome something we have not been offered , and therefore my proposal is that the following should be included : 'expresses its concern and discontent with the lack of compliance by the council with the assurances expressed by the italian presidency to parliament ' .
i would still like to hear him say whether he really believes that this report offers more flexibility to a broader range of food companies and not just micro-enterprises .
respect for national rules on transparency is not guaranteed by the proposal .
to the governments i say : anyone who now wants to achieve something different will destroy this compromise on the services directive .
my colleague mr schmid has tried to contribute to these efforts in this report .
this is disappointing because the delay and laxness in the violation of deadlines established by the community bodies are far greater than on other matters , harmful to the environment , in which rapidity is the rule .
which member states with a federal or autonomous political structure similar to spain 's include representatives of their nationalities and regions in their delegations ?
however , there are still too many areas for which we must say that things are not acceptable .
what i was describing - and i would like to come back to this - was the reality after the european court of justice judgments , which stated that internal market rules apply to healthcare even if it is publicly funded .
during the press conference , a journalist asked the two prime ministers if they had reached an agreement on investment .
on summits : we have lots of different summits .
what , then , are our values and principles ?
the house will know that transport operators are awaiting the new directive in order to set timetables for transport services and many other sectors whose activities are related to the dates of the summer-time period are eager for conclusive arrangements .
the eu is in close contact with mr fayyad , the minister of finance , and is helping him establish transparent institutions and machinery in the financial sphere , for we all want to see the country 's financial and economic position improve , and the release by israel of the customs and tax repayments it has retained - which the european union has called for on repeated occasions - would help to achieve that .
as the proteg√© of parliament , the commission is emerging from this crisis weakened and discredited .
we must sort this sort of thing out much more quickly in future .
the declaration must then be entered in a register , along with the names of the signatories .
my opinion is that this directive , which was drawn up jointly by the council , parliament and the commission , will in fact help to safeguard human rights and the rights of citizens , in particular their right to life and their right to a life in safety .
apart from some ideas reiterated in this house by a number of speakers - flexibility and the liberalisation of certain markets , particularly the service market and the labour market - , the report emphasised that one of the main reasons why the united states takes the lead where job creation is concerned is that it is far more committed to research and development . also , private initiative plays a much greater part in that joint effort and there is an option of encouraging r & d through tax incentives rather than direct aid , thus linking projects to making a profit .
this is fear that women and children , in particular , should not have to put up with in the 21st century .
commissioner byrne will make a statement to us , and we will then discuss it using the 'catching the eye ' system and ask our questions .
finally , we have also set out a very specific procedure to be followed in the event of the decision being postponed , in order to highlight the need to develop the procedure further rather than simply leaving it as it is .
i augur that whenever an agreement is concluded , insistence be made upon the principle of reciprocity , and i believe that it is these type of agreements that can serve as the foundation for this to happen elsewhere .
it also calls on the european commission to draw up a practical guide for employers , in particular smes .
after all , this is not something dreamed up by one party or another ; it has become clear that the promotion of renewable energies represents an important element .
as always , we have some candidates who are lagging behind , but i am sure they will make up the ground .
this ghost wants to say a few things about the presidency .
this is a considerable fly in the ointment of the composition of the court , even though the present candidates include a very impressive lady .
i have often said that there is an important balance to be struck between measures to ensure security , on the one hand , and the protection of non-negotiable fundamental rights , on the other .
and it remains to be seen how exactly the council proposes to improve the rights of people from third countries .
therefore , standardisation should be clearly defined .
this meeting is still going on .
i believe it is very important to bear it in mind and i hope , as i have said , that all our colleagues will show solidarity .
they are characterised by a poorly developed infrastructure , a fragmented agricultural structure and high unemployment , some of which is hidden on peasant family farms .
the group of the greens/european free alliance has tabled four amendments which , mr president , we can not support , because they mix concepts of illegal fishing with the content of this regulation , whose operation in practice has shown that the control filters established by customs in las palmas have worked correctly .
i should like to touch upon two questions which do not directly concern reconstruction but which are of special importance for the future not only of kosovo but also of the entire region .
it is also justified to extend aid to cover the work the agencies are doing in cooperation with central and eastern european countries .
so let me explain the german position to you once again in unequivocal terms .
this is possibly more important than funding and other matters .
in political terms , the european union is a close cooperative association of independent nation states .
while the european parliament , as you know , is about to adopt a resolution on the acta agreement , and this is still causing considerable disquiet and is far from finding unanimous support among our fellow citizens , i think that it would be useful for us to have a very clear response from the us negotiators on two points . can acta be ratified by the united states ?
however , farming is in a unique situation : even though farmers have to cope with climate change , livestock epidemics , natural disasters and global sectoral crises , much of which they can not even predict , let alone plan for economically , they still need planning security .
you have always chaired with efficiency , courtesy and , most important of all , humour .
the agreements on the accession of denmark , finland and sweden to the convention implementing the schengen agreement and the agreements between the council of the european union and iceland and norway concerning the association of these states in the implementation , application and development of the schengen acquis contain a provision stating that these agreements must not constitute a barrier to cooperation within the framework of the nordic passport union to the extent that this does not oppose or obstruct implementation of the agreements .
there must also be a greater emphasis on the simplicity and practicability of community policy if its effective implementation and application in every eu region is to be guaranteed .
unfortunately , not even the npt has been able to prevent that .
sometimes i think that , although it is a matter for subsidiarity , eu citizens should be protected from their respective governments .
. mr president , the committee on regional development supported this report with a large majority .
the aid must benefit the destitute populations in turkey .
mr president , i would just like to say that my name does not need to be recorded .
some crops will have to be used for purposes other than food , for example as fuel and in industrial processes .
in my view these changes would not only make it possible to strengthen budgetary discipline in the member states , but would also improve the coordination of fiscal policy at eu level .
president-in-office of the council . ( de ) mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is a pleasure and a great honour to address you today for the first time as representative of the presidency at the plenary session of the european parliament .
more broadly , we believe that the very serious question of the extra-territorial application of national american legislation should be raised to its full extent .
great declarations , great words and great policies are all very well for existing undertakings , but it is essential that those who - inspired by the entrepreneurial spirit which we are so keen to promote - decide to create a new undertaking , are not faced with obstacles and difficulties which prevent them from going ahead .
turning quickly to the section of the resolution on fighting fraud , corruption , mismanagement and nepotism : the major new proposal of the report concerns reporting by commission officials of perceived wrong-doing .
the systems we currently have are not watertight ; we know this .
he , fortunately , failed miserably in this , and you will have the same experience .
the finnish presidency has ended wretchedly from the point of view of preserving the non-alignment of a non-aligned state .
i am therefore a very happy rapporteur , knowing that we have reached this agreement .
abject poverty is at the root of child slavery , and child labour contravenes the treaty on the rights of the child .
in this sense , the members of the european parliament have demonstrated that they are mindful that fundamental rights and liberties , which are the very principles of the democracies and of the european union , must be respected .
it is important that the whole package should be implemented as swiftly as possible , since that will also enable us to acquire the knowledge we need to set to work in other areas : to quote just a couple of examples , the taxation of company profits and transfrontier working would appear to be good candidates for this .
even though the unanimity principle continues to apply , making certain policies difficult to pursue , perhaps a way could be found by means of structural support .
we are aware , however , that these measures - at least in the way they have been implemented so far - are not sufficient to achieve satisfactory results .
because there was no political agreement , despite the fact that the practical possibilities were there : and just look at what is happening in albania now .
the violations and violence not only affect their bodies , through hunger and the concentration camps , but also their minds , for they have been brainwashed and left unable to think , as in the soviet gulags ; the north koreans have been reduced to sheep that follow their leader blindly .
the 2009 work plan also fails to mention what plans the commission has for monitoring member states that want to make use of further restrictions after the 5-year restriction , in the interests of the free movement of labour .
the uk , us , new zealand , canada , philippines and thailand have now committed manpower and material to the peacekeeping force .
i shall finish , then , by turning to mr abitbol , who expressed himself fully within the convention .
it was not at all perfect .
this , of course , will enhance the credibility both internally and externally of the eu 's very strong commitment to fundamental rights .
it will also discuss stepping up the fight against organized crime and seek to give an impetus to cooperation between the member states in this vital struggle .
so , on the basis of transparency , we can not justify monitoring of the procedure by clubs from the national bureaucracies , while the national parliaments and the european parliament remain outside .
in order to make significant progress in terms of equality before the law , equal opportunities , including equal remuneration for work done , and equal access to human resources and other production resources which provide more chances , we - the european parliament and european commission - have the opportunity to and must encourage member states and civil society to adopt effective measures .
therefore together with five of my fellow members from four groups i would like to encourage you to urge manufacturers of industrial products to affix braille labels to their containers on a voluntary basis .
if you would just permit , i would like nevertheless to say - with all due respect to mr kamall , for example - that when the market does not function , it is for the political leadership to intervene .
in writing . - ( pt ) the resolution takes a wide-ranging approach to the problem of aids/hiv , supported by current data .
situation in china after the earthquake and before the olympic games ( vote )
i should also like to reiterate the question as to why the commission does not bring a member state before the court of justice if it is clearly in breach .
this is sad .
the fourth question is : what measures does the commission intend to take in order to ensure that existing european social law is respected before any decision is made by any group ?
here , i think we are talking about guant√°namo bay .
this reflects many of the recommendations put forward in your report .
the island regions face great difficulties as a result of natural and economic constraints .
they think that the airports are local monopolies and exploit their monopoly position in order to impose unreasonable charges .
if corruption and crime gain the upper hand here , life for ordinary people will become intolerable .
that should be another purpose of politics : to prevent it , to help the families of the victims and also to prevent people from forgetting and therefore allowing similar dramatic events from happening again in the future .
please do not tell us that it is the college that will decide .
if you think that intervention costs are lower , i would point out that across the eu , the total amount in intervention has reached 150 000 tonnes .
communist misrule has ensured that the malnourished people are left out in the cold and are deprived of proper medical care .
what is beyond question , however , is that we have clear indications that this is not a particularly successful scheme , and although the commission has data showing that it is not successful , we are now about to include aviation in the scheme as well .
we have known of morocco ' s intention not to renew the agreement since the day the last agreement was signed .
the lisbon strategy must be implemented in its entirety across all its strands .
it is , in fact , to help with these preparations that the eu special envoy , ambassador moratinos , visited the region at the end of august .
secondly , mr president , i am concerned about the distribution of seats in the european parliament , because what you have adopted violates a principle that is in the treaty , which is degressive proportionality .
what purpose do clauses about respecting women 's human rights in the cotonou agreement serve , commissioner , if there are no sanctions ?
i am among those who expect that in the next period , we should have proposals for even stronger synergies between a strong cohesion policy and all the other funds , based on the fact that all of them together can deliver far better results than each one on its own .
however , vacuums and deadlocks are dangerous . the community 's heads of state and government must make prompt decisions and come up with an unequivocal solution .
for these reasons , and for consistency , i reject amendments nos 3 and 37 .
mr president , the essentials have been covered , but i should like to reiterate the point that the right to propose legislation rests with the commission .
plainly , the commission is not a college of amateur chiefs of staff and plainly , we want to work successfully with the high representative and with parliament to ensure that europe has the security and defence policy that it needs and that its citizens want .
that is why the board of management and the director must have relevant experience .
in addition , there is no solidarity between the regions .
there has been significant progress with trade relations , although there is still no comprehensive agreement .
firstly , the concern that blindly waging war on terrorism might lead , if this has not already happened , to less care being taken to promote , protect and safeguard sacrosanct civil and human rights .
good employment provides the satisfaction of participating and the self-sufficiency necessary to meet the needs of the more vulnerable members of society , such as children and old people .
secondly , with regard to the question of utilizing structural funds in the way that has been suggested , yesterday we had the commission reporting on the abolition of duty-free , saying that it would allow for state subsidy for certain regional transport sectors to ensure that they were not at a disadvantage .
the disputed issue relates to the delegated acts and parliament 's options to exercise its rightful scrutiny over the use of the eu 's financial instruments .
that is the first building block of this legislative package .
fourthly , we must ensure that the provisions on data protection are proportionate and effective and only last for a limited period of time .
i had my speech prepared , but having heard the reply which the commissioner has just given us and the words of mr jov√© in his presentation , i believe that i am going to forget my notes and try to improvise in reply to the commissioner ' s response .
mr president , at this stage in the debate i do not want to waste time repeating the content of the vecchi and rocard reports , which are both clearly excellent since the committee on development and cooperation voted unanimously for them .
for that reason i have always been critical of this commission proposal , or rather the proposal prepared by parliament 's administration , because it does not deal with the question of implementing regulations .
why not make a deal between federalists and realists , whereby you federalists accept a europe governed from the national parliaments until such time as participation in elections to the european parliament exceeds participation in national elections ?
british conservatives want opportunities for british industry and british r [ amp ] d , but this resolution does not guarantee that .
this means that we have no legal basis for getting started on that desirable global vision in the union .
let me assure parliament that it is not my intention , in setting out these two procedures - articles 17 and 17a - to ensure that the european parliament does not ask for rights that it does not have .
all of this will make a significant contribution to strengthening the international system under the aegis of the united nations and this is a point that i would like to emphasise .
politicians and senior officials are now openly discussing how to get around the results of these referendums .
let me briefly outline the main reasons for the reform and the central elements of the overall agreement reached .
we should also like to reaffirm our condemnation of racism , xenophobia and all forms of discrimination .
we have painful experiences within the european union of the effects of terrorism and the threat that it presents , not only to individuals but to societies , democracy and our fundamental values .
this was clearly a step designed to keep opposition to a minimum before next year 's election .
i would like to thank the rapporteurs , particularly mr decourri√®re , for his sensitivity towards the regions and for accepting our amendments .
mr president , we shall not be voting for this report as the rapporteur insists on the need for financial viability , which basically means that we have to restrict the level of spending in advance .
however , today they are notoriously inadequate .
we must not fail that test and therein lies the challenge .
we have called for years , and will continue to call , for such a dialogue .
explanations of vote
this probably can not be a solid legal ground for immediately building our own minority rights concept in the acquis communautaire .
i hope that the member states will participate in this conference by providing representation at the highest level and publicly reaffirming their commitment to the icc .
liberalisation alone will not help us reach our pretty meagre kyoto targets .
all this attention is fully justified in view of the worsening unemployment and the difficulties caused by the economic crisis .
this framework decision if implemented also challenges traditional values of free speech and this is harmful , not helpful , to good race relations , which we all desire .
with regard to the procedure , mentioned by mr cappato and mr berenguer , what we intended is something very important : to obtain a directive which could enter into force before 1 may 2004 .
although legislation adopted by the european parliament provides sufficient guarantees and compensation for passengers , if , due to the fault of the airline , they are unable to take off on time on the planned route or have problems with luggage , this can only be guaranteed if the airline is not experiencing financial difficulties .
apparently , not all members have received a copy .
please do not confine millions like me to a second-class citizenship simply because of our appearance and by ignoring our contribution .
it is that croatia , the country which has currently made most progress in negotiations , might manage to accede to the european union during the not-too-distant polish presidency .
independent and transparent elections are the cornerstone of democratic states and if russia wants to be among those , it has to fulfil the standards .
mutual recognition has to work better , and all parties on the ground have to accept their responsibilities here , member states and the commission too .
mr president , referring to the mediterranean and the middle east , the council has just indicated ‚Äì and i quote ‚Äì ‚Äòthe union‚Äôs willingness to work with the united states for the purposes of cooperation in the region‚Äô .
( es ) madam president , commissioner , we should certainly congratulate ourselves today on holding this debate .
the european commission ought to assess the nature of the state aid granted to opel and inform the house as to whether this was not perhaps a case of protecting the local market at the expense of factories and jobs in other european union member states .
the next item is the report ( a5-0084/1999 ) by mrs palacio vallelersundi , on behalf of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , on the verification of credentials of members following the fifth direct election to the european parliament on 10 to 13 june 1999 .
i put it to you that he might find a few things that would make him feel rather at home .
what pressure is the union prepared to exert on israel over gaza and the west bank , including jerusalem , to remind its current and future leaders that membership of the international community in general , and the privileged partnership with the european union in particular , come at a price , that they have no place for military occupation , nor war crimes , nor a policy which pushes each day towards a divorce between europe and the arab-muslim world ?
parliament has now lost control in this area and has simply given in , and has unfortunately not applied the precautionary approach .
this is to give companies an incentive to achieve such goals .
olaf ( european anti-fraud office ) was encouraged to conclude , as soon as possible , outstanding enquiries there .
waived institutions would therefore always be registered and monitored by the supervisory authorities .
i think that is sensible and i commend it to the house .
that is why , after it had consulted the member states , the commission felt it necessary to seek approval of an amendment to regulation ( ec ) no 1083/2006 , which is limited to article 55 ( 5 ) and relates to the following two points only : the exemption from the provisions of article 55 of operations cofinanced by the european social fund and the definition of a threshold , set at eur 1 million , below which projects financed by the erdf or the cohesion fund would be exempt from the provisions of article 55 as regards calculation of the maximum eligible expenditure and as regards monitoring .
in addition , the statute will put an end to the lack of clarity relating to assistants ' remuneration .
unless these measures are adopted , it will be impossible to implement a policy to boost the economy and to sustain demand in the short- and medium-term .
it is so that we may guard against any form of revisionism , any historical untruth .
the third point refers to possible future amendments .
of the four names mentioned , for example , two at least would be considered to be generally used as first names .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , you have before you two commission proposals concerning the rotterdam convention on the prior informed consent ( pic ) procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade .
we have remained in monetary union , but we are not moving on to economic union .
i refer mainly to the sectors of services , industrial products , the facilitation of trade and the protection of industrial and intellectual property .
we live in a world where half a million people move from a rural environment to an urban environment every single week .
the objectives of achieving strong , sustainable economic growth and increasing the employment intensity of that growth are receiving considerable attention , not only in the broad economic policy guidelines , but also in the wider work of the commission and the european council .
mr president , as we approach the first european council of the italian presidency and assess the progress thus far , is the glass of prosecco that the presidency will offer next week half full or half empty ?
( the sitting was closed at 11.40 p.m . )
the commission did however change its view regarding the maximum dose . it revised its initial proposal of 350 mg/l and supported the proposal of 250 mg/l .
mr mayol , the council will reply in writing , as it is obliged to do .
what other weapon do we have in order to pressurise israel to take its responsibilities seriously in that region ?
madam president , beginning with the situation in the azores and in greece , may i say that the commission obviously sympathises very much with the victims of the fires in greece and the earthquake in the azores .
we are on the right path here .
at last there would be a minimum of dialogue and transparency in the functioning of what is often regarded as the 'brussels bureaucracy ' .
in my opinion , the commission‚Äôs proposal is not too limited .
in writing . - i am in favour of this report as it deals with some of the current problems which have gone unaddressed by governments .
these bodies must fulfil the criteria listed in euro norm 45011 and would be licensed by the relevant public authority , as is proposed in the amendment .
the committee on budgets has long been asking for this .
i wish the programme every success .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , mr president-in-office of the council , commissioner , i would also like to start by thanking most sincerely the three rapporteurs , mrs buitenweg , mr costa neves and mr sepp√§nen , for the work they have put in .
if i look at what is happening with article 301 of the penal code , freedom of religion and the law on foundations , minority rights and so forth , it is clear that the erdoƒüan government is trying to make progress , but it has always stopped short of what is required because quite obviously , at a domestic level , the limits of turkey 's reform capacity have been reached .
i hope that the union might serve as a model to northern ireland , that so much more can be achieved collectively than apart .
the potential of this cooperation also extends to other areas , such as education , energy and scientific research .
the outcome of the summit will be a political declaration , negotiated among the fao membership .
new jobs will be created where the new technology is first introduced .
furthermore , all of the commission 's proposals fully reflect the undertakings made by the community in international agreements , including those relating to trade policy and the environment .
in writing . - ( fi ) i voted in favour of mr foglietta 's own-initiative report adopted by the committee on nutrition , overweight and obesity in our public health strategy .
( the speaker agreed to take a blue card question under rule 149 ( 8 ) )
if that happens it will be a major disaster for the future of the whole of the union .
we must therefore look at the issue from the point of view of development aid and combating poverty .
madam president , mr president-in-office of the council , first i would like to welcome you to your first part-session here . i can assure you that this new presidency of the council already enjoys a good advance reputation and we hope that good reputation will be reflected in an equally good outcome to the negotiations with south africa .
unemployment is the most urgent social problem of the present time .
finally , there is support for disadvantaged regions .
at the root of this is the huge and terrible gap between the real economy and the speculative bubble : a virtual wealth in paper form that hugely exceeds real wealth , based on production and on investments .
what we have been trying to do is to get belgrade and pristina to talk about matters of common interest , such as the return of refugees , security issues , energy and other networks and so on , where by definition cooperation is needed if greater trust is to be generated between the two sides before moving on to the next stage , which is the discussion on final status .
the reality is that this house has given its opinion on fundamental issues concerning the reform of the olive oil sector .
with regard to human rights , i am amazed that we have dealings with papua new guinea when this country still penalises sexual orientations .
nevertheless , we are now going a step further .
whilst the coherence of the action plan 's recommendations should be highlighted , european citizens still face many obstacles .
it is not about competitiveness as such , but about ensuring that europe is competitive so that services can be provided for the people .
when we look at the programme itself , the diagnosis does not improve .
2010 will also be the year when the effective implementation of operations will start , requiring the performance of ex ante controls by the commission on extensive numbers of tenders and contracts .
it is very important for croatia to join , but it is also important to remember that the pope warned the croats to beware of a bureaucratic , centralist structure .
this important issue is the subject of our discussions today .
i recall that the eu spoke out for women with one voice under the spanish presidency of the council and was able during negotiations to argue important points and include them in the action platform from this position of strength .
that is my conclusion today .
mr president , i should firstly like to thank all the political groups for the interest and commitment that they have shown with regard to the drawing-up of this report on respect for human rights in the european union in 1994 .
each party has stood up for itself .
the debate between competition and service of general interest has only just started .
since the time i submitted my question , i met the commissioner and we discussed aspects of the trafficking in people .
subject : commission steps to eradicate polio in africa
corrections to votes and voting intentions : see minutes
in the field of alzheimer 's disease there is a need for accurate data , which can only be collected at eu level , to allow for planning and adaptation of health services at member state level .
this is surely where the real work has to be done .
then we have all the new concerns where our actions can go much further .
we can not allow matters like the strengthening of economic and social cohesion , which is one of the basic principles of the treaties , to be marginalised - as is happening with the problem submitted to us today .
that is relevant for anyone living on the continent of europe who can simply get into a car or hitch hike to take his savings to a luxembourg bank , but i do not think anyone will feel inclined - unless he has many millions - to take an aeroplane for example from a regions such as the canary islands , guadeloupe or martinique to place modest savings in a luxembourg bank . that is when all is said and done a great disincentive .
it should also contribute to a feeling of citizenship , social involvement and , when it comes to europe , respect for cultural diversity .
developments in the area of human trafficking and human smuggling also point to a pressing need for clear immigration policies , for transparency , for unequivocal rules and for access to the common labour market .
now , as we begin the transition into the 21st century we have the great chance of moulding the european union in such a way that we , and the generations which come after us , will in future live in peace and democracy , in prosperity and stability .
the current cap is the union 's most archaic , least fair and most job-destructive instrument .
where this particular environmental issue is concerned , we know what is causing the problems .
this is at all events an agreement which is a small step in the right direction .
their absence seems to be a fact of life , particularly in the healthcare sector .
we must pay attention to the point made by both the commissioner and the rapporteur , stressing the basic geostrategic situation of the kingdom of morocco .
however , from a historical viewpoint it has to be said that there is no evidence to support this assumption .
the network of female judges recently arranged a conference in rome , also with the support of the stop programme .
the retail chain lidl does this deliberately , as these people , who are mainly young , have to return to their own countries after the holidays , and will not be in a position to claim the money owing to them .
i believe it is essential for civil servants to be accountable to the general public .
we must continue to promote the development of a world order founded upon the rule of law , but that rule of law must not just serve the interests of the rich western countries .
namely the question of the effectiveness of the many lines where there are payment problems .
do you know ?
the next item is the commission statement on the situation in the middle east .
one of the north korean government 's core demands would appear to be that it should be allowed to negotiate directly with the usa .
parliament 's communication budget and the actions planned for 2009 should therefore make sure that they interest and directly affect european citizens , who often feel that the european institutions are too detached .
to help the single market ?
the other problem is funding .
i think that we in germany would need a north/south and an east/west corridor .
crisis in the dairy farming sector ( vote )
when i put forward the proposal for a 'social ' rate of vat , as part of preparations for the luxembourg summit - and i was not the first to do so , because an option had already been put to members of the house previously - i believed that i was acting in the spirit of the delors white paper , which had already pointed out that we in europe had saddled ourselves with a system which made labour extremely expensive , very expensive in connection with our profligate use of energy , raw materials and the totally free movement of capital .
in this respect we ask for member states to take measures to promote equal treatment and equal opportunities regardless of religion , disability , age or sexual orientation .
we can in due course provide a minimum of humanitarian assistance if and when the situation allows .
this is an important moment , as we are coming to the end of a process that will see the conclusion of the latest wave of enlargement .
the issue of how to regulate the freedom of entrepreneurs to provide services demands a nuanced regulation and careful handling , and the member states must not be discharged from their responsibilities in that respect , for it is they - and not those who make europe 's laws - who have to ensure the highest quality standards .
this exposition of the internal workings of the crisis which the commission is going through , and with which all the european institutions are faced , would contribute towards usefully placing the analyses of the independent experts in their global political context , which is characterised , in the terms of the forward studies unit document in question , by the exhaustion of a certain manner of organising public action , by a crisis in governance which is clashing head-on with the european union .
i also support europol having a community footing , requested in amendment 5 .
in the course of its development , the union had five years to prepare for the external market , but with binding legislative instruments .
i proposed , for example , that the digital tachograph measure not only driving times and rest periods but also loading and unloading operations , supplemented by a kind of unmonitored fixed time for a number of other activities , such as administrative tasks and also cleaning and similar operations .
as i said , we must recognise that it is a difficult battle .
what was not done in amsterdam for political reasons , which we can readily guess , should be done first , before any concrete expansion ; what was not done can be justified by being impossible technically , time-wise and politically in amsterdam , but can never become a mental reservation for not achieving expansion or , on the contrary , for using expansion to make the powers of the political union less effective and empty .
mr president , i would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on an excellent report .
the place of the state has been taken by a number of warlords , who alternate between fighting and cooperating with each other .
the commission will remember better than i the excitement with which the natura 2000 network was launched .
mr president , on behalf of my group , i , too , should like to add my voice to the congratulations addressed to the rapporteur .
i would like thank the shadow rapporteurs who have contributed to the report and the rapporteurs for the opinion of the relevant committees .
since the military junta has no intention of helping the people of burma , we are against the military junta .
if this is to be a reality rather than an illusion , then the opportunity to move with social security benefit , with guaranteeing rights of social security , must be seized .
the council quite rightly rejected this kind of approach .
there is no room for explanations or justifications .
can the council and the commission confirm this distribution ?
that is how far we actually are from any sort of common understanding of what protecting the climate is about , and common ground on this point is very difficult to achieve .
we the community have submitted proposals for listing several marine and timber species on cites , so i think this will be a very important discussion .
it has been stated before that we here in europe can encourage our member states to say to the pharmaceutical industry that it can make cheaper products .
by just such a generously tailored quota for production resulting from social and environmental agreements , eu development policy objectives can be made more visible .
it also includes an improved safety assessment , tailor-made to different types of foods , thereby allowing safe traditional food from third countries to enter the eu more easily .
this parliament showed its commitment to that in the conciliation process in last year 's budget when we fought for and achieved additional funding for the present socrates programme and the commission and the council do not doubt the overwhelming agreement across the parties in this parliament to put extra money into education .
madam president , i signalled i wanted to raise a point of order , although it is not actually on the minutes .
i would draw parliament ' s attention to the fact that this is indeed a natural disaster for these floods and this rain were twenty times greater than normal .
i have to admit that i had serious misgivings during the first reading of the directive .
the commission underlines that , over the years , budget implementation has improved considerably .
that is one problem .
all the issues at the heart of this evening 's debate were examined , starting with the issue of the agencies and the european railway agency .
this is the main reason why , in my opinion , emission reductions have to be much more ambitious in the near future than what is currently being discussed in the eu and by the un .
but so far , not so good , because , as far as surveillance is concerned , we have established an early-warning system to detect airborne chemical agents , but its usefulness is limited , since it only operates for certain substances and would not guard against the contamination of water or food supplies .
( de ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i voted in favour of the leinen report because i am convinced that by recording this data in the various countries , we will learn far more about the situation in these countries .
i should like to say a few words on that .
reaching agreement on this issue would have been much more beneficial to each party concerned than continuing the legal wrangling .
it is like the metaphor involving the glass : some see it as half full and others see it as half empty .
there were over 100 larger floods in europe between 1998 and 2004 .
lastly , i believe it is important to increase european funding for the internet of things in the context of research projects under the seventh framework programme and pilot projects under the competitiveness and innovation framework programme , and also to focus on the development of broadband infrastructure , the roll-out of broadband and the further reduction of data roaming costs .
that is a good point .
it simply has not .
there was broad agreement that nato , as the institution that had assumed responsibility for handling the balkan crisis , should be charged with assembling information from all those involved regarding the use of depleted uranium , the location of military contingents , and all medical data .
we therefore propose that the commission delegations become community delegations so that their relations with the council may be closer , through the high representative of the cfsp , as well as their relations with the european parliament and its members , thereby guaranteeing greater efficiency and political control of their activities .
. only a few of the amendments not accepted by the council were taken up at this second reading .
this includes a new career system and merit-based promotion .
it is also important in order to highlight the fact that this slave trade is another example of the violence to which women and children are subjected .
the region has made steady progress over the past couple of years and once the major risks of instability , like the aftermath of the kosovo status process or the fragility of democracy in serbia , can be handled well , then i am sure that the region will have a very bright future and that this future is , indeed , in the european union .
today is a special day , 13 april 2000 , the date of the so-called 'trial ' .
i have just one supplementary question .
also , i am surprised to see that the reports which were scheduled for yesterday 's voting time have now been put back , with priority being given to four of them , and with no qualified majority requirement to justify this reversal .
i am happy to report a very satisfactory outcome from the environment council of 23 march .
i would think that we are set fair just now for a major breakthrough in the progress and development of the european employment strategy .
eu project bonds would thus secure the investment required , would attract the support they need , and would become an important mechanism for maximum leverage of public support .
mr casini 's report does not meet these requirements .
it is quite a disgrace .
if the majority is in favour of this proposal , i would like to propose a second roll-call vote to wind up the debate with a resolution .
there should be a clearer division of developing countries that takes into account factors such as economic strength , economic development , gdp growth and growth in exports .
if we achieve all that , then i believe that not only will it be a step in the right direction , mrs thyssen and mr goedbloed , but that it really will be the first step on the way to reform and a political union .
the rapporteur 's proposals are unacceptable .
in the field of , 'visas , asylum , immigration and other policies related to free movement of persons ' , the council will act by a qualified majority in the foreseeable future .
the present regime for nuts and locust beans has been in place for ten years , and the first quality-improvement plans expired in the year 2000 .
past evidence of this is the way in which we collaborated to get synthetic drugs onto the political agenda .
today , i voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the progress report on turkey .
on the other hand , experience has also shown that a greater degree of flexibility is desirable , that the ceiling for expenditure on foreign policy was simply set too low and that the capping of administrative expenditure is liable to create its own problems .
i note with interest that an amendment has already been tabled to remove this .
in my view , the message of this debate and of the debates over the past five years to the turkish government should be that this support , despite inadequate reforms , will only persist if new reform proposals are made without delay in all three areas .
the document that will be approved by the special general assembly must be geared towards action and must pursue the following objectives .
this is sufficient for the swedish government , and it is clearly sufficient for all the other governments in the council .
subject : continued muzzling of freedom of expression and violation of the rule of law by turkey the leader of the people ' s democracy party ( hadep ) of turkey and 17 other members of the party leadership have been sentenced to prison terms of three years and nine months on charges of supporting the hunger strike organised in support of abdullah √∂calan when he was handed over to the turkish secret services in kenya .
as the honourable member says , it is a constant fight , and i look forward to going along that fighting path together .
we do not need to support and to take into consideration the atomic energy industry , but only the health of european people , our electors , and what is good and bad for them .
this has happened thanks to the engagement and experience of the new member states .
many of our citizens are asking this now .
i should like to address one more fundamental point : both the president-in-office and the commissioner mentioned the stabilisation and association agreement .
but another thing that is going to be very important is that the supervisory architecture being put in place from 1 january must work , so that the stress tests and so forth are sufficient to recognise what is happening in the future and people are brought to heel if they are getting out of hand .
( applause )
the internal market embodies the key principles of a globalised economy with advantages for europe in terms of competition .
my third point concerns maternity and childbirth leave for self-employed women and assisting spouses .
obviously i can not go through the long list of our relations with all the world 's regions now , but i will just mention two or three examples .
in the text submitted and adopted i emphasised both the importance of children acquiring a basic knowledge of ict already from primary school level and the added value that online learning can provide to our society , which is in constant flux .
we must ensure that this also includes those countries whose future may lie in the union , but which will not be able to become members of the european union in the next ten years , for whatever reason , and we must ensure that they are not left out .
on the other hand , eu policy is based on limiting the amount of agricultural production , and this policy is beginning to appear increasingly at odds with the needs of consumers .
many of the cogs in this mechanism have not worked , however , and many of the issues opened up by the treaty of maastricht are still on the agenda today .
i would add that , in my opinion , this is especially true for sheep farmers .
the doors to european union states have been slammed in lukashenka‚Äôs face , yet president putin is welcomed with open arms .
it would be advisable for the european union to take steps which are vigorous enough to ensure that the united states does not bank on its and our friendship to infringe something which is a sacred principle : the sovereignty of nations and peoples and their freedom to trade with whomsoever they wish .
however , it has now been decided to extend it , as part of this arrangement on customs security measures , to agricultural products .
fifthly , i hope to see a broad information campaign on the new possibilities for cooperation in our countries .
we could not agree to the splitting of a single fisheries stock .
we can not artificially make the prosperous countries more prosperous .
why is it that the european council has decided at this time that there is any reason to re-examine the eu 's arms embargo against china ?
thank you , mr kamall .
we must go further .
despite that , i consider that there are no objective grounds for completely exempting one type of alcohol from excise .
that way , there is no need to go out on the streets and demonstrate . that way , new jobs can be created .
but the inclusion of annex xv in the accession treaty means that voting for enlargement endorses its inclusion .
in writing . - ( hu ) i would like to draw attention to the fact that while women represent approximately 4-5 % of the prison population in europe , and while the proportion of women in prisons in many european countries is growing at a faster rate than the male prison population , prisons themselves continue to be designed primarily for men and tend to ignore the particular problems of the growing female prison population .
i think , therefore , that there is no need for us to continue isolating taiwan .
it will also provide channels for the greater involvement of national parliaments .
but we still have concerns about the dialogue between the commission and olaf in the budget process .
many do not dare report assaults for fear of deportation .
the first fisheries agreement with the country dates back to 1985 and this is one of the most important tuna agreements in financial terms .
at present , the commission is concluding its considerations in connection with the task with which it was entrusted in the context of the action plan , of elaborating proposals for measures against fraud and against the forgery of all types of means of payment , including credit cards , and of examining inter alia the introduction of harmonized bases for punishable offences in relation to certain actions .
we know , as i mentioned in the question , that coreper urged the commission , which is to say the interim commission , to submit a proposal .
mr seselj has been held in solitary confinement since december 2004 for granting interviews to serbian newspapers , but the prosecutor , mrs uertz-retzlaff , speaks against him in the press freely .
the united nations security council needs to adopt swift and energetic measures to put an end to these massacres and appalling violations of human rights , and especially to the inhuman treatment being meted out to the refugees from rwanda and burundi and people displaced from other areas .
hardly any country emerged unscathed .
it is essential if we want to exit the crisis successfully , restore growth , translate that growth into more and better jobs , and ultimately ensure a sustainable and inclusive future for europe .
this text has the merit of recommending the establishment of a moratorium on debt and the cancellation of that debt for the poorest countries , of advocating food sovereignty and of undertaking to respect the ilo .
in fact , it runs the risk of getting its feathers torn out !
that praise , i think , is due .
mr president , there is something repetitive about our six-monthly debate .
if they do , we could do without a parliamentary resolution .
replacing rules by other policy instruments is one of the main objectives of the fifth action programme .
the irish lesson is a good one .
so let us resist the temptation to overcomplicate or to make artificial linkages with other subjects , and let us not allow ourselves to be distracted from the task in hand .
however , there remains a glimmer of hope in my opinion , commissioner .
to face up to this demographic challenge and to be in a position to take the necessary political decisions - the arbitration will have to be political - the member states must first of all once more find sufficient budgetary margin for manoeuvre .
i should like to raise two important points .
the waste crisis in naples was a direct consequence of infringements , occurring year after year , of practically all the community rules on waste .
we are here to do a job and it should be recorded both for the archives and for television just like any other session .
it could have happened in any one of our countries , given the intensive subsidy-driven nature of european farming , which involves the constant movement of livestock from farm to farm and indeed from country to country .
but it still falls short because its track record of reform is not quite substantial enough .
that is what we have to address , and for that fp7 is a very important building block .
with the enlargement to the new countries , europe is entering a historic stage which will mark a turning point in the geopolitical evolution of our continent .
material aid in the form of food and medical aid is also urgently needed .
europe has its view as to how it does its business and the united states has its view as to how it does its business .
whilst we of course welcome more stringent measures , they should not lead to a watering down of the obligation of professional secrecy for various professions , and above all for lawyers , notaries and tax consultants .
in terms of economics , the country has made great efforts under the auspices of the imf and is benefiting from a structural adjustment facility provided by that organisation .
last but not least , particular attention must be focused on agriculture because it has been hit extremely hard by the economic crisis .
in my opinion attempts at eu level or at national level to intervene in the organization of companies or in another way to limit their freedom of action will be counterproductive , that is , they will not help to create new jobs and increase employment .
we have confidence in the peoples of europe and therefore believe in a europe that means greater democracy and not the opposite , which is greater bureaucracy .
i am firmly convinced that science , innovation and research are the main drivers of economic growth and job creation in europe .
almost 50 years after the signing of the treaty of rome , that established the european economic union , finally europe is going to have its own constitution .
i want to conclude with the possibilities that will be available within state aid schemes .
i was very much impressed by the explicit expression of appreciation and support for the work of the customs union ; i can assure you that it will continue .
we must be clear in our work to ensure that next year ' s world summit for sustainable development in south africa achieves the necessary results .
the council also acted decisively to meet the first deadline set in the declaration ‚Äì that is for the draft directive on compensation to victims that has been bogged down for some time in arguments about the legal basis .
this is the proposal which was included in the rules for participation .
protection of animals at the time of killing (
. this parliament has long supported the development of the second phase of this programme designed to fight violence against women and children and to combat trafficking of human beings with a special focus on women and girls who might fall victim to abuse .
firstly , the internet is an area of freedom , modernity and equal opportunities , where people communicate with each other , mix with and provide information to each other , exchanging ideas and sharing knowledge .
we are all aware , and it has already been noted by a number of members , that all possible steps should be taken to support every initiative aimed at saving species which can still be saved , because nature continues to be destroyed at a breathtaking speed .
spain has always been very committed to europe and has always been very pro-european .
quite apart from the abolition of market rules , the risk is that we end up with a european standard-issue concept of what services of general interest are , and europe is too heterogeneous for that to be our goal .
i believe that europe will not ignore , but fulfil these recommendations .
when the committee was debating this , the commission even sought to persuade us that all the problems with the directive had nothing to do with europe , but largely resulted from defects in transposition at national level .
the present compromise addresses some of the existing inequalities .
the eu has repeatedly stated that the non-proliferation treaty is the cornerstone of the global non-proliferation regime and the essential foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament under article vi of the treaty .
the legal framework established by this directive will facilitate the adoption of other community directives , such as the one on copyright , the distance marketing of financial services or the controversial brussels convention on jurisdiction , and will clearly help to remove the risk of incompatibility between these initiatives and the principles of the internal market .
at the present time it can only attempt to do this , and that is why it is an interim report .
abolishing these restrictions would help to avoid the problems arising from undeclared work or bogus self-employment .
but do not go back and tell the fishermen of europe that it is the european commission which is to be blamed .
b5-0251/2000 by mr queir√≥ and mr ribeiro i castro on behalf of the union for a europe of nations group ;
the agreement must be brought into line with the rules of procedure , not the other way round , which is what mr bourlanges ' proposed amendment appears to be demanding .
moreover , paragraph 64 states that , if cyprus is reunified , the european union would be ready immediately to ‚Äòaccept turkish as an official language‚Äô .
to have reached this final stage is a positive advertisement for the european parliament .
we share this view .
perhaps the commissioner will see fit to favour the needs of harmless recreational fishermen in the uk in the same way as her predecessor showed open sensitivity to the needs of his own country 's fishermen when he opposed a ban on the sale of bluefin tuna , an industry that earned eur 100 million a year for his country , malta .
let us not forget the contribution that the structural funds already play in raising qualification levels and making labour policies more active .
thirdly , police cooperation and the exchange of intelligence require proper monitoring by the legal systems and parliaments .
both the eu and russia must keep in mind that a true partnership can only be a straightforward relationship .
and we have to fight for that .
so , social rights , environmental protection , national and regional development , the preservation of natural resources , concern for the collective interest , and freedom of unions are all subjects which could justify sanctions , as would community preference .
i had hoped that the commission would go further , that it would have the courage , for once , to submit proposals , and that it would be able to do what the council of ministers is asking it to .
i refer to the reuniting of families .
finally , we must act in a balanced and coherent fashion .
other member states , such as germany , spain , portugal , the czech republic and sweden , together with the commission , participated in this exercise as observers .
of course , we all felt that our safety was being threatened everywhere in every way .
these restrictions will not make the slightest different to the slorc .
i do realise that we have a little more time this afternoon , but let us not get entirely carried away , please !
when discussing china , we should always bear in mind the foundations on which this house , and the entire european union , are built .
the continued requirement of unanimity in this area is a factor leading to paralysis and ineffectiveness .
today , everyone has discovered this phenomenon , and we can only be pleased with the unanimous nature of the commitment .
legally , at least , there would clearly be a conflict of interests .
it is every bit as real as the iraq war .
from a strategical viewpoint , the commercial presence of the eu would also counterbalance the influence and dominance of china and the united states .
this will make it possible to protect human rights more effectively and , at the same time , to limit illegal immigration .
the commission could partially accept the proposed amendment for an extension of the cases of mandatory origin labelling .
( applause )
it has gone out of fashion to talk about eu enlargement , but it should be stated quite clearly that eu accession for a number of balkan states would be a very good idea .
the security council , too , is in need of reform .
this will also support the process of reform there , which has been pursued successfully for the last two years .
as a result , our question is as follows : when will the european union lay down rules on origin marking for imports or for products manufactured in the various member states ?
one final point : the question of the armenian genocide is , strangely , becoming increasingly important with the passing of time .
now that our people have rejected the superstate , has the time therefore not come to tell europeans the truth ?
the state‚Äôs primary task should be to avoid interfering in such matters .
there is no evidence that the problems with it , such as they are , would warrant a large intrusion into the domestic tax arrangements as contemplated by this commission communication .
the report by mrs de esteban martin on respect for human rights in the european union covers far too many subjects for us to be able to consider them in depth .
how is europe going to provide for these people ?
however , i am still not entirely satisfied .
it would certainly be counterproductive to make an offer - as some have already tried - when the russians want nothing to do with it .
you can read the written statement which you were given yesterday .
southern europe , on the other hand , suffers from oppressive heat waves and ferocious fires .
if we take this fact into account , as well as the fact that women also have to work this 35-hour week as well as looking after a home and family , it becomes clear that a woman‚Äôs lot is indeed harder .
commissioner dalli , it is the commission 's job to help enforce the law and to be on the citizens ' side .
better , stricter standards are good news for public health , local authorities and construction firms alike .
president barroso is not here at the moment , but i think he needs to tell the council that it needs to redefine the political agenda in at least three areas .
the rapporteur was right to emphasise the role of public sector broadcasters as the guardians of diversity , with a mission to broadcast high quality information .
finally , i wonder , what has happened to european sensitivity and our humanitarian values , when we are incapable of resolving the drama of refugees and immigrants despite witnessing daily tragedies such as the recent suffocation of eight immigrants in southern ireland ?
we really must make progress in preparing and adopting legal regulations on geological capture and storage of co2 .
it is also very important to draw up a specific programme aimed at promoting decent work , guaranteeing workers ' rights throughout europe and improving working conditions , combating inequality , discrimination and in-work poverty .
i can make a commitment before parliament , which represents all european citizens , that the spanish rotating presidency will be loyal to , and will cooperate with , the new institutions .
firstly , it was stated that the establishment of a common european border police neither should nor can be hurried through .
the commission intends to continue its efforts on intellectual property issues with russia through a structured intellectual property dialogue , similar to the one with china .
it is the only way , and we will need to continue on this path .
an analysis really needs to be carried out of all the national adoption systems to see what their strengths and weaknesses are and to recommend the best practices for adoption by member states .
this is particularly unfortunate , because this was a very sound point and would also have given us the opportunity , for example , to have a new president of the european commission directly elected via the political parties and via a european list .
safeguards of nuclear materials are extremely important within and outside the european union .
the european union must definitely make a more active commitment in the future settlement of the nagorno-karabakh conflict .
14 amendments are partially acceptable : amendments 1 , 2 , 4 , 9 , 16 , 17 , 30 , 43 , 44 , 67 , 71 , 72 , 78 and 93 .
i trust that , if this legislation is created , an opportunity will open up for us to work using union resources on cleaning soil from pollution and protecting its quality .
the fp√∂ supports the political statements and the declarations of intent in this motion for a resolution , but is abstaining from the vote on the text as a whole , because the additional increase in financial and economic aid to this region , as called for in the motion , does not appear to be adequately structured or guaranteed to be efficient .
elimination of violence against women ( vote )
global warming is the major challenge of the 21st century , and europe must , emphatically , continue to set an example .
this house , and the eu , are testimony to that .
the vote will take place at 12 noon .
in my view , the union must ensure that they receive that support , and promote their full recognition by society .
surely we should first make a success of the current enlargement , and only then can we think about making new promises .
it is a key point because the situation in algeria has been extraordinarily troubled for at least a decade . it has experienced , inter alia , a period of relative isolation in terms of international relations , particularly relations with europe , not least in that there is a connection between algeria and the african dimension and it is important that this aspect of relations is strengthened too .
the central-western pacific area accounts for 60 % of world tuna resources , which are of special interest to community tuna vessels and longliners .
it is therefore very annoying that this knowledge or insight has not made much of an impression upon the committee on constitutional affairs , which has not appreciated that it was important in this area too , which is quite new and of great relevance to the eu , to try to make democratic progress .
i have heard , however , that the commission is planning such a ban for poultry too .
the use of uranium weapons has devastating and irreparable consequences .
rapporteur . - mr president , it is good to get the vote on the 2007 budget under way .
it has been the good fortune of western europe for 60 years , and since european reunification in 1990 , large areas of europe have shared in this good fortune .
i therefore welcome baroness ashton 's visit to cairo next week .
madam president , i should like to thank the commissioner for having drawn attention to the fact that research can be supported via structural funds resources .
by granting discharge , the european parliament is throwing away the most important tool it has ever had at its disposal .
mr president , i wish to begin by saying to the greek presidency 'efcharisto poli ' .
if a person is granted asylum in a member state , she should have the same rights and obligations as other citizens in the country .
among other proposals , we have been asked to approve rules on administrative procedure and administrative justice , an area where there is a great vacuum in community legislation .
hearings , two reports and numerous resolutions which not only spurred on the council and the commission , but also had a positive effect outside the union .
please allow me to make three further points .
after all , the beneficiaries of this report are european citizens .
to come to your last point , as far as preferences are concerned , whether for social performance or environmental performance , have we any alternative ?
given his experience in this area , i believe i can safely endorse his evaluation , and his demands for external border security .
the same applies with regard to the 18 extra meps .
member states need to increase their ramp inspections to weed out those airlines which are based in one country but register in another and have lower standards than we would expect within the european union .
it is only now in 2010 that we are beginning to see a glimmer of hope that the overall economic situation might be improving .
in its cooperation with bulgaria , the commission gave particular priority to both of these questions .
it should also be pointed out that the lisbon and feira summits have reiterated the need to move ahead with liberalisations .
we need a solution that unifies the countries of europe and that does not put the burden of responsibility for the action to be undertaken on the member states .
that is something that the council presidency will have to deal with ; let it tell the council 's members that that is what we need the money for .
it is a typically political instrument that should , however , not be treated lightly , but should serve as an instrument encouraging responsible individuals to carry out more rapid and proper transposition .
i am increasingly certain that we will improve this with a substantial majority this week , but we want to get on with that .
i repeat my opinion which i made clear at the second reading of this report in january 1998 .
we have already guaranteed a unilateral 20 % emission reduction by 2020 , and we are committed to increase to 30 % if comparable efforts are made by others according to their responsibilities and capabilities .
how could we maintain farming activities over all the territories involved and protect designations of origin , while at the same time reducing support and opening up more borders , when we have no positive sign that our partners are ready to accept the proposed compensations and limits .
the next item is the debate on the report ( a5-0080/2004 ) by mr gra√ßa moura , on behalf of the committee on culture , youth , education , the media and sport , on the role of schools and learning at school in giving the greatest number of people access to culture .
surveillance must build on the existing instruments . the key instruments for fiscal policy surveillance and economic policy coordination are clearly anchored in the treaty and , indeed , in the stability and growth pact .
the treaty on the functioning of the european union obliges the council to produce guidelines for the employment policies of the member states every year and to consult the european parliament before adopting these decisions .
member states should opt for the energy mix that causes the least pollution possible .
is our support of human rights and international law credible ?
the unilateral withdrawal from gaza has itself weakened the position of president abu mazen , for obvious reasons .
. mr president , whilst i assume this generous gesture applies to the second speaker from the floor today , i shall attempt to keep it brief .
every year , we approve a budget including funding for aid , including aid to latin american countries .
however , in most member states , renewable energy can meet neither our environmental targets , nor our accelerated energy demands , nor our need to remain competitive in global markets .
this entailed a levelling-down of working and living conditions .
but how is it possible , i would then ask mr rothley , that you have spent three months negotiating with this selfsame council in the knowledge that the council , which has to reach a decision by unanimity , would very probably put forward amendments ?
for 30 years , we have failed to curb overfishing in any real way .
they kill off any innovative initiative .
in that case , should the commission consider that the new project does not comply with european community law , a new procedure would be initiated afresh .
financial resources and institutional reform of the monitoring mechanism will be the main subjects on the agenda .
policy proposed by the council and commission receives our unqualified support , but in my view , the key to change lies with belarus‚Äô other neighbour , not the eu , but russia .
( nl ) mr president .
. mr president , i am extremely grateful for the minister 's comprehensive and very clear explanation on the prospects for the summit with the russian federation .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , first let me express my sincerest thanks to the three rapporteurs , mrs kla√ü , mr arias ca√±ete and mr viola , for their outstanding reports and for the constructive manner in which they have worked together with the members of the committee on regional policy .
people can abandon their political ideas .
the economic , environmental and social policies of our countries will be governed by it .
this will eliminate the possibility of discrepancies arising between decisions of the european court of justice and the european court of human rights .
mr president , the agreement between the social partners on part-time work is , to be honest , even more dreadful than the original one which covered parental leave ; what is more , the treatment of part-time workers is undermined by countless exceptions in this agreement , and the flexi-workers have simply been fobbed off .
this is our duty to our children and all other living beings on this beautiful planet .
i must say that this is an important issue that arises again and again : 20 % for education , health , water , etc . you know the reply .
( b5-0152/2002 ) by mr oostlander and mr morillon , on behalf of the group of the european people 's party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats , on tunisia ;
that shows why the family , as has been said , is the key place where we must promote the rights of the child .
since 2004 , political contacts have increased in profile and intensity .
i closed my eyes for a moment and saw the beagle boys walking along the european parliament 's corridors , and then i had a brainwave .
the wall violates the fourth geneva convention , specifically in the two areas of prohibition of the use of collective punishment and prohibition of annexation , which can not be abrogated by invoking military necessity .
the bse scandal forced us to ask the european commission to present a proposal , as quickly as possible , extending the scope of the basic directive to primary products , i.e . products of the soil , stock-farming or fisheries , and game .
the trips+ agreements must definitely not become incorporated into the economic partnership agreements and undermine these countries ' ability to provide their populations with medicines .
as an example i can mention that this program has been tried by the swedish communities for every individual citizen to be able to work with environmental questions locally .
in return for its deadly expertise , sinn f√©in-ira received six million dollars and the people of colombia received mass murder and destruction .
i would still like to ask , perhaps with my swedish hat on , why the swedish security police has systematically videoed peaceful anti-eu demonstrators in demonstrations where no incidents whatsoever occur .
mr president , i agree that the report as it stands is now admissible , but that is because changes were made that i and parliament 's services asked for and which the services upheld .
financing opportunities should be widened , simplified and made more readily available using the funding currently provided under the european social fund and the lifelong learning programme .
the european council will then adopt a view on the continued process at the meeting in laeken/brussels in december .
- before the vote
thank you for what you have done for this parliament .
in writing . - ( de ) i am voting against the report because there is no longer a clear line between the various amendments , which i consider important .
another basic consideration is that the aim must ultimately be emissions-free air traffic .
in contrast , the addition which the commission proposes to make to that definition creates problems , and it is scientifically difficult to accept that animal or vegetable cells can be defined as micro-organisms .
i believe that we should have the courage to say exactly what commissioner piebalgs said , namely , that the world bank has a very deliberate energy strategy .
there is agreement in the commission , there is agreement in the council , as i understand it , and there will also be agreement in this parliament .
of course we greens also voted against the langen report as a whole , but it is not true , mr langen , that this changes nothing , and i want to make that quite plain here .
with each company they will have to give flesh and blood to this agreement in collective labour and others agreements , because we are not doing it now .
. mr president , parliament‚Äôs committee on development expressed decisive support for the constitutional text , in the belief that it represents historic progress by establishing solidarity with those who need it most , development cooperation and responsibility in humanitarian assistance , wherever it is required , as defining characteristics of the european union .
i can still remember the debates in this chamber when the opinion was that postal services would die out anyway , because we could use faxes and e-mail .
in the presidential consultations of 5 october 2003 , we saw yet another step in the gradual resumption of normal political and administrative life in chechnya .
they can serve as criteria in the forthcoming legal instrument if a number of modifications are observed ; including the 'exceptional character ' criterion , with regard to which the discontinuity clause should be retained .
this involves , firstly , stepping up the eu‚Äôs prevention strategy , preparedness and ability to respond .
a lack of urgency has become apparent with regard to the council 's progress on a number of points .
of course international intervention was an absolute must , an obligation , and we did not do what was necessary .
consequently , extensive structural reforms are also needed in the different european markets .
mr president , the council and the commission should take good note of parliament ' s practically unanimous position in favour of the relaunch of the union ' s mediterranean policy , as was established at the euro-mediterranean conference in barcelona in 1995 , under the spanish presidency , and whose characteristics have already been highlighted here .
broadcasters should now and always be guaranteed their own frequencies , because they never have the money to take part in auctions .
it is , therefore , regrettable that these peace talks have been suspended for the time being .
the second issue is related to the fact that those economies that are the most strongly affected by the crisis have to cope with a combination of high risk premiums and severe austerity measures .
the commission fully accepts that genuine ethical rules are essential to ensure good governance and practice in professions such as lawyer .
in this connection i would once again urge that denmark give up its reservations on eu cooperation in the area of legislation .
unfortunately neither the rapporteur nor the compromise proposal take sufficient account of this responsibility , of consumers ' rights and consumer protection .
strong emphasis should also be placed on eliminating differences in men and women 's pay by 2020 , since this currently stands at about 18 % .
‚Äì mr president , mr president-in-office of the council , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the desire of each and every party to defend its own position means that it is not an easy matter for parliament , the council and the commission to set about rearranging their relationship .
we could draft as many as rules we like , but if they are not implemented in common practice , then they will ultimately have little effect .
in view of the fact that the programmes will in part be continuing up to 2006 , no further measures are planned under this budget heading .
now , we all know that making use of this procedure is a novelty .
for this reason , i would like to congratulate both the rapporteur and the commission , as well as commissioner ferrero-waldner and the swedish presidency , for finally consigning this delay to the past .
in the long run the conditions for world peace and a response to the greatest security threat to the modern world can not be created without it .
i appreciate the efforts he and colleagues in other committees have undertaken to consult with the different parties in the fishing industry and i am pleased to note that their response has been almost unanimously positive .
i would , however , like to say a word about nuclear energy .
i believe that we must have a far wider-ranging debate on this subject .
however , amongst its many and , i believe , very valuable , proposals , i would like to draw your attention to certain issues which , on this forthcoming celebration of the silver wedding of mountain farming , should receive very special , and in some cases new , attention .
the main aim is to respect the commitments made on both sides .
the year 2000 budget ended with a surplus of eur 11.6 billion , as has been mentioned here several times .
a number of members of the council were not prepared to accept that reference should be made to this issue other than in a recital .
thanks to on-going research , much more knowledge is available to us today than it was eight years ago .
we must not be tempted to create the illusion of a great leap forward .
it should be stressed that it is thanks to your determination that this was made possible ; it is thanks to your sense of compromise that we finally achieved it .
this is a welcome proposal .
any such concession , mr president , would immediately threaten the system of trade between the community and third countries wiping out community preference and actually exposing community production to world competition .
that is not an argument against reforms , but we are profoundly sceptical about much of what is to be found in , for example , the working times directive or in the services directive .
children are going to have to learn by using the new technologies , not just learn to use them .
this is a serious deficit which our institution should be able to face up to , particularly on account of the complementarity evident within the union .
for example , we are also concerned about the security of fossil fuels such as oil and gas , and the rapporteur 's statement regarding the unlikelihood of world production exceeding 100 million barrels per day ( currently 87 million ) . when requirements in 2030 are estimated at 120 million barrels per day , as well as the risk of a major crisis during the next decade .
i am opposed to all proposals aimed at tax harmonization because i think the citizens of the eu 's member states should have the exclusive right to tax themselves .
with the proposals already made - many of them already approved by this parliament and by the council , some still in our decision-making process - we are indeed taking the lead globally in the reform of the financial international system .
that is why i here call upon the various portuguese members to vote in favour of this measure and therefore bring pressure to bear on the portuguese government to end the blocking position which , unfortunately , it is adopting in the council .
we can not take it for granted that relations between japan and europe will develop as closely as those between europe and the united states or between the united states and japan .
we have introduced the concept of reciprocity , which would apply not only to opening markets and to market access but also to the nature of regulatory provision and supervision .
i would simply like to say to you that this modification , this amendment of the regulation , is a first step in granting the necessary supervisory powers to the european securities and markets authority , and that , as has been said , other revisions of this regulation will take place shortly . i think that , on this issue , and on many other important issues raised today , this will truly be an opportunity to bring together the whole debate in the revision which the commission is getting ready to propose to us .
the debate is closed .
one of the measures set out in the proposal for a regulation that we are voting on is the creation of a scheme of port state control that would prohibit access by third country vessels involved in illegal fishing activities .
besides , the commission proposal is not a market mechanism .
we discussed these matters a short while ago with mr konar√© , between the commission of the african union and the commission of the european union , and we would be somewhat well advised to bear in mind , as you , yourselves , have , that the problem is not limited to spain or to morocco : this is a problem affecting the whole of africa and the whole of the european union .
this will shortly be reporting and will shed considerable light on these matters . it has addressed the strengthening of europol 's role in this kind of matter and the question of contact magistrates and justice cooperation which mr dankert mentioned .
this is not what transpires from the texts .
the legislation offers an alternative to full ownership unbundling , using the iso model .
he states , namely , that proactive water policy has a positive impact on the well-being of recreational water users , and i could not agree with him more .
the stakes remain very high at a national and an international level .
in the council , a minority opposes it and parliament is divided more or less down the middle , given that in the delegation to the conciliation committee , on the final evening of debate , the voting was concluded with 8 votes for and 6 against , with one member abstaining .
we do not need to relate to plan colombia .
the remainder will be used to finance measures to aid the malagasy fishery sector by funding scientific research programmes and monitoring programmes such as inspection and surveillance operations .
it is not a question of stigmatising this or that government or this or that member state , but these diatribes reveal this rise in homophobia within the european union .
the concept of a sole negotiator may have more effects than simply weakening the control exercised by the member states over the commission - it may also , by restricting the number of opinions we can express from 15 to 1 , erode our diplomatic room for manoeuvre .
surely it weakens the credibility of our human rights policy and of our security policy if such people are our allies ?
there must be a safe and consistent delivery of humanitarian aid to those in need .
we certainly need a discussion in our country about whether we should be in the european parliament or not .
more serious still is the fact that the same consumers were also denied the possibility of obtaining a refund for flights that were cancelled due to the bankruptcy measures affecting these airlines .
while i am not a member of the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy , i am one of the vice-chairmen of the delegation for relations with the peoples ' republic of china and so take a considerable interest in what is happening there .
( sk ) mr milinkevich , mr kozulin , i am delighted that you are here for today 's debate on your country , belarus .
you must give the convention all it needs to be a success .
the same applies to basque and numerous other languages .
to summarise very briefly , the economic situation is not particularly favourable , but since this assessment still falls within the levels forecast in the stability programme and in its 2001 update , we do not feel that the problems are as serious as some speakers are suggesting .
it would therefore be better if there were measures to combat the piracy of information networks and to combat theft of pensioners‚Äô money .
this is completely absurd !
we also run the risk of seeing a descent into the sort of ethnic tension we have been horrified by in yugoslavia . we also run the risk , as mr wiersma has said , of undermining the security of the continent .
we must give greater priority to the expenditure supporting the development of the new knowledge-based society and dare to provide smaller subsidies to those parts of our economy that are too large and that belong to the economy of a different era .
fourteen years ago , we in lithuania were similarly aware of the majority in the west feeling sorry for mikhail gorbachev .
i still think this is questionable , for two reasons .
naturally , members of parliament know as well as we do that we do not have competence in this area to force either the member states or the applicant states to do anything .
so what is different ?
what can the eu do under italy 's leadership to strengthen the eu 's positions on this issue ?
it is equally important to require the consent of the country of destination and to apply a system of notification in writing .
i should like to ask the council to bring mr solana to order .
the council decided at the first reading to finance an across-the-board cut in the appropriations for external action .
in addition , the committee considered the activities of the so-called jugendamt , the german authorities dealing with young people ; many complaints were lodged against the jugendamt .
i would remind you that article 103a of the treaty states that : 'without prejudice to any other procedures provided for in this treaty , the council may , acting unanimously on a proposal from the commission , decide upon the measures appropriate to the economic situation , in particular if severe difficulties arise in the supply of certain products . '
this presidency left its mark on the freedom agenda the moment we proclaimed here the charter of fundamental rights and that was a decisive moment for the european project , and the charter of fundamental rights , as i have said earlier , now has legal force in the treaty of lisbon .
any withdrawal , any ostracism on the part of foreign diplomats , would strengthen the retrograde and destabilising forces in a region of the middle east which is as far from us in geographical terms as it is geo-politically sensitive in our view .
i am against discrimination of any kind , even positive , as it inevitably leads to the creation of victims .
in that respect , i endorse what the commissioner said .
while a majority of members voted in favour of this rejection , there were 40 votes too few to reach the qualified majority required to validate the rejection .
after consultation , we have decided that we want to substitute the ppe-de 's amendment no 9 for the first part of what we decided on in committee .
what is really lacking is a credible desire to assume greater global responsibility in the realms of mediation and crisis management .
at the outset i should like to thank all those who brought us to this stage , particularly those in the secretariat of parliament 's committee on budgets and those associated with it .
pan-european infrastructures are essential to an integrated financial market , with market participants , regulators and competition authorities all playing a role .
considering the amount of money spent by the military on its own upkeep and the tight hold it has on national life , one might at least have expected it to be able to respond to the needs of its own people in a humanitarian crisis .
it is outrageous that a dangerous criminal should be able to hide behind a lack of information about his criminal record so as to evade justice or commit crimes in other member states .
i believe that both renewable energy and atomic energy are needed .
let me first emphasise the increased forms of accountability that we have negotiated .
there are other possibilities , but i think we should try to find the right balance because , if it is only a question of prolonging the pain , then we gain absolutely nothing .
this is an important exercise through which the commission confirms the sharper focus on growth and employment and provides the member states with a single coherent framework for the preparation of their respective programmes .
on this basis , ladies and gentlemen , i believe we should be able to reinforce the european perspective for use as an instrument in the area between membership and the neighbourhood policy and thereby widen the area of stability , peace and freedom in europe without endangering the development potential of the european union .
there are four matters to which i would like to draw your attention .
everyone knows this will only apply to main lines with a heavy volume of traffic and that competition for public services will concentrate on profitable lines ; the rest will have to provide public services under conditions which are sometimes less than favourable .
the way in which saddam hussein conducts politics and has conducted politics in the past is a danger to other nations .
for the french national front , the debate on the work of the intergovernmental conference provides a further opportunity to condemn here in the house the anti-national , federalist , centralizing and bureaucratic logic of the present model of european integration .
the cairns group , which used to have 17 countries , had 17 negotiators .
one-fifth of the eu25 selfishly broke away , and the enlarged europe received yet another slap in the face .
according to the dutch court of auditors , this is partly due to the loose and opaque wording of eu legislation .
despite the many improvements to the commission proposal that were introduced during the consultation with the committees , for which we mainly have the rapporteur , mr schwab , to thank , in my opinion the current package contains an excessive number of regulations and will result in over-complex legislation .
the reason is clear .
safety belts will enable us to tackle this , and i hope that both the commission and the council of governments will summon up the energy to do something about this .
let me deal with a point which i know is of very great concern to many of you : the implications of the recent european court judgment .
there is only one legal problem standing in the way of reaching an agreement with you : the usual 'delegated act ' problem .
these address a number of areas , including the complementary risk-assessments for surfactants that fail the ultimate biodegradability tests , so that a tiered approach can take into account exposure and risk .
it is in this bosnia that local elections have now been held for the first time .
but there are aspects with which we disagree , such as the link that is claimed between energy efficiency and what is called the europe 2020 strategy , which provides for the creation of a single market in energy , the promotion of market-based instruments , the european emissions trading system masking some of the profits from energy efficiency , and overlooking the need to defend a strong energy public sector that each state needs to promote .
is this the purpose of the euro area ?
commissioner , i believe that the commission did not pay any attention to these wishes because , at that time , it was confident that the arbitration within the world trade organisation could agree to the establishment of a tariff of eur 230 .
i would like to point out that , within this broad consensus , there were some groups which said that the majority of parliament should form an opposition to the majority of the council .
de br√©mond d'ars report ( a4-0388/96 )
that , mr vanhanen , is why mr barroso is right when he says that we should agree on specific principles for stable relations : transparency , legal certainty , national treatment , and mutual opening up of and access to markets .
the possibility for workers to move freely is important for both the employees and businesses alike .
a repeat of the conflict of a week and a half ago , when the armies of both countries shelled each other , is unacceptable both from the point of view of the people of the region , who are in danger of being killed , and from that of the temple , which , despite its inclusion on the unesco world heritage list , has sustained damage .
anyone who knows that the european parliament can not concern itself with his resignation and nevertheless urge his resignation is deceiving either himself or public opinion as well as the parents of the murdered and missing children .
they would have significantly less difficulty in collecting one million signatures .
in conclusion i would like to quote the words of the opinion from the environment committee which sums up the issue very well : ' in summary it must be said that the commission has a problem : it really wants to promote nuclear power .
- before the vote on amendment 26
it must be safeguarded by institutions in which all parties place their trust .
you will have to excuse our taking the commission 's professed aims so seriously .
i thus aligned my practice with the conclusions reached in june 2005 by the council , which provide for the use of those languages to facilitate spanish citizens ' communication with the eu institutions .
the emission of co2 must be drastically reduced .
similarly , a link should be established between consumer protection and regulation of sales promotion .
i am keen to establish what precisely we are doing here tonight .
the ima was thrown out of the oecd window only to return through the wto door .
i have brought it just to remind us how difficult this treaty is to put together .
( parliament approved the minutes )
madam president , in reference to wednesday 's agenda following the point made by mr bar√≥n crespo , last tuesday i and two other members of this house had the honour of meeting with the former king of afghanistan , mohammed zahir shah .
nevertheless we also need new arrangements in future , and we need an action plan for co2 emissions from road and air transport , which are increasing dramatically .
europe simply can not live with large population groups in the eu rejecting our culture .

they do not speak , however , of rejecting those ideas that led and inevitably lead to dictatorship and oppression .
my second question is this : do you not believe that the psychology of a besieged fortress in israel , which , in the past , was a driving force behind its foreign policy , now has much less justification , because the threat posed by what are becoming democratic regimes is very much less and also because democracies do not go to war against each other ?

i understand that the rapporteur , mr giansily , wishes to examine the recent commission proposals for the continuation of some ecsc activities after 2002 before finalizing his views on the draft budget for 1998 .
mr president , it would be very good if each and every european citizen realised that free movement is our common treasure and must not be limited by any interests , as is the case for instance near s√°toralja√∫jhely .
we can hardly talk about freedom of movement on this tiny strip of land which has its own sense of time and observes customs and traditions which date back thousands of years .
within this specific area , of increasing importance , the codecision procedure will apply to many more fields and this will obviously broaden the ep 's power to examine some of the proposals set out in your report .

in writing . - given the scientific uncertainty and ethical questions involved , i fully support calls for the commission to bring forward proposals seeking to prohibit the cloning of animals for food supplies .
