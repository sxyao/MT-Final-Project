some of the main changes introduced by the committee on fisheries also move in that direction , trying to limit any application of the comitology procedure to details alone and insisting that the council should have rules at its disposal in order to establish seasonal closures , net dimensions and measures to eliminate or reduce discards , for we understand that all community fisheries have to be bound by certain rules that are the same for everyone .

we condemn ourselves with this constitution to always and in all cases being towed along by others - grumbling , of course .
i also have a case concerning mr hörchner , another dutch national .

the last speech showed how intense the discussion within the committee on women ' s rights was , because it is quite true that the 1976 directive played a remarkable role , but 25 years have passed and both social behaviour and the role of women have changed .

so it might be a good idea to take stock of a few basic facts , such as the increase in crime , the operational limits of the state , whatever form it takes , and where the european taxpayers ' money is going .
through this explanation of vote i have made my position clear , because , in addition to the objections i have stated , which determined my vote , i feel that mr napolitano deserves my intellectual respect for his work and for his efforts to increase the role of national parliaments in the eu , rejecting the simplistic plan to give the european parliament exclusive rights to represent europe ' s citizens and to be the guardian of democracy in the relationship with the other institutions of the union .

the procedure can be adapted in time , if this proves necessary in the light of the reform of the cap . fortunately this reform has not yet come into force , as the commissioner has just stated .

the extensive discussion here has focused mainly on labelling because this often misleads consumers , and i therefore warmly welcome the fact that new claims about the effects of products must be documented .
i also feel apprehensive because of the uk government’s stance on the renationalisation of the european economic and social cohesion effort , which , were it to happen , would amount to a terrible lack of solidarity not only with the new member states but also with certain regions that are still in need , namely portugal , spain and greece .

i would therefore like to thank the two rapporteurs and all the members , who i know have participated very actively throughout the discussions in committee , and to remind them of something that we all know : until 2000 this sector has developed systematically , in the intergovernmental field , by means of eurocontrol or the international civil aviation authority .

the euratom treaty is deficient and that must be rectified so that we can have the sort of directive we need .
we can obviously disregard them and prefer to believe , like the president of sun micro systems at the world economic forum in new york , that globalisation is a good thing and that nothing needs to be changed .

today before this house , on behalf of the european commission , i would like to pay tribute to all those who are playing a part in this peace process : to the governments of the united kingdom and ireland , to the secretary of state for northern ireland , dr mo mowlam , and to ireland 's minister for foreign affairs , david andrews , both of whom we particularly welcome here this afternoon ; to the parties in the talks ; to the outstanding chairmanship of senator george mitchell and his fellow independent chairmen - former prime minister harri holkeri and general john de chastelain .
this has been proven by hurricane mitch , which has ravaged central america and brought the international community to life .
until milosevic genuinely gives way , there is no reason to stop the nato action , however welcome such a pause might be .
as you know , the success of the round of trade negotiations launched at doha , eighteen months ago now , is still the european union 's primary concern as regards trade .
there is simply no time for private life or having children .
therefore , i support the actions of the council and the commission , in particular , the prospect of an action plan for belarus .
some member states speak of solidarity but do not practise it , which reduces the effectiveness of frontex .
in the future too , it will , on a purely constitutional basis , be the member states that are responsible for health care within the european union .
consequently the commission returned to its previous practice .
having condemned , what we have to do is look at how we can improve the situation .
of course , mrs palacio , you are absolutely right ; we do have a motley jumble of provisions .
we must put an end to immigration policies that turn immigrants into some sort of subhumans with no rights , if not into illegal immigrants preyed on by the police .
in writing . - ( de ) i have not voted in favour of the directive on airport charges at the second reading , just as at the first reading , because what is being proposed here will lead to unacceptable discrimination against luxembourg airport .
the construction of the fence , or the wall , was also the subject of a united nations general assembly resolution on 21 october , which all eu member states and the accession states co-sponsored .
it has proven to be the case that the bank 's moderate interest rates policy has contributed to the invigoration of the economy , even though that same policy has very often been criticised in recent years .
it follows , then , that we must ensure that the haulage firms and the drivers who work for them do not see the rules and the monitoring of them as some sort of bureaucratic harassment , and that we must , rather than allowing people to talk only about the evils of europe , always turn the conversation round to the added value that will accrue to it through improved road safety .
when we bought several buildings in strasbourg some years ago , whether or not they contained asbestos was very important .
some member states have close relations with libya , but it is important to ensure that such relations are duly anchored in the fundamental values and interests of the union .
those caring for patients should be guaranteed appropriate financial and psychological support .
we have a long way to go before we can expect agreement on an eu-wide harmonised system of taxation which would encourage greater biofuel production .
this does not mean that the same policy will apply to all islands .
even when what is now sudan was known as anglo-egyptian sudan , it was debatable whether this huge area with widely differing populations should become independent as a single state .
everything that can be done to improve the situation should be done .
one aspect of regulation that is particularly important is the exclusion from the scope of the directive of those substances which would have been banned without any scientific evidence , thus damaging the numerous businesses which operate in the market .
it would be premature to present more concrete proposals in the current environment , given the fact that these proposals depend on the budgetary situation .
i feel very strongly that we have played an important part .
these two objectives are by no means mutually exclusive and should be pursued at one and the same time .
the commission is doing all it can to encourage and pursue the member states to stick to those targets .
the high price we need to pay for this will even lead to many europeans not having a sense of victory when the project proves successful .
i therefore call on all of us to be courageous , to achieve a swift conciliation procedure and to work together to ensure that our success story - improving air quality in europe - really is a success right to the end .
i voted in favour of the report presented by mrs kokkola , with the exception of point 7 concerning natura 2000 , a point taken even further by the upe group 's amendment no 1 , against which i naturally voted .
mr president , globalisation and technological and demographic evolution have led to far reaching changes to a number of areas of life in our societies .
we also must oppose the reference to planks forming the scaffold deck as this implies that scaffolding systems that use prefabricated boards are not covered .
we would like to point out , once again , that the assistance provided by the globalisation adjustment fund should not replace measures which are the responsibility of companies by virtue of national law or collective agreements , or measures for restructuring companies or sectors .
with regard to trade , the parties mutually agree on most-favoured-nation treatment in all matters connected with customs duties , provisions relating to customs clearance , transit , warehouses and transhipment , and methods of payment and payment transfers .
ambiguity is very wrong here .
various dutch fellow meps have made statements in the media to the effect that the liberal group refuses to prescribe ethical limits for scientific research .
the lack of common rules is having different effects on europe 's citizens , even though all member states have helped trigger the crisis .
everything indicates that the situation in that country will become more critical as a result of the presidential elections that must take place no later than september 2006 .
the way forward still lies largely in our own backyard .
for example , in finland , parents can look after their child at home until the age of 18 months , on average , and we can afford it , because at various stages , employers , workers and taxpayers , too , share the costs .
we must dare to make demands of the surrounding world .
mr president , commissioner , that was a highly technical description of something that is going nowhere .
therefore , those who are following my advice will vote against the first part in this fifth vote and then we shall have an extra vote , which is not on the voting list , on this oral amendment , which i support .
let me say again that the slovenian presidency will do everything in its power to achieve a balance between the various interests , and also to ensure that the solutions we accept will make the european road transport industry more efficient and more competitive .
i say this because the restructuring process will continue , and diversification in the textile regions should guarantee the preservation of jobs in these areas , especially for women .
the liberal group is very much in favour of both continuing to use existing energy sources and starting to use alternatives .
furthermore , the council of ministers has only recently set up a high-level group specifically to study the countries from which large numbers of people are trying to reach our nations .
secondly , over the course of a number of years , i have witnessed the surprising fact that many of our partners want the european union to have a uniform foreign policy and defence identity which is better defined and more powerful .
ladies and gentlemen , i agree with those of you who have asserted here that the mixing together of substances which are highly contaminated with dioxins , and which is suspected here , is still a criminal act and not an animal illness .
the reasons are obvious : price , competition and the desire to lower the cost to industry , so as to make europe more competitive against our competitors , both in north america and in asia .
as the members of the european parliament know , we are in an extremely critical phase in the history of macedonia .
in common with the rights already enshrined in the convention , it is also important to lay down precise provisions ensuring that the public is properly involved in the decision-making process concerning gmos , and directives guaranteeing public involvement in international fora .
for a liberal , these freedoms are at the heart of our democracy and are non-negotiable preconditions for eu membership .
europe is undeniably becoming a leader , even if not everything is satisfactory .
the excellent reports by mrs malmström , mrs ludford and messrs haarder and belder offer us europeans the opportunity for analysis and , above all , self-criticism .
our future strategic partnership goes well beyond trade .
i would also remind you that as far as pensions are concerned , even if very often it is thought that a pensions system by pre-funding is the way forward , there are many of us , the trade unionists , employees and others , who think that the current system of distribution can be upheld or in any case combined .
we also oppose the charging of an additional service fee .
irrespective of the country involved , it is no laughing matter for parliament when the security bureaucracy in this house - and i use the word bureaucracy advisedly - stops members at every turn but is unable to prevent this sort of incident when turkey is the subject of debate , when you would expect them to , given that there has already been one such incident .
the dublin system has often been criticised for the negative impact that it may have on asylum seekers , especially in the case of families or vulnerable persons .
mr van nistelrooij 's report covers this vast area of territorial cohesion and expresses effective views on the commission 's communications in this area .
good sense , justice , would want us to withdraw the rules on the cap since it was the price to be paid for the cancún goods which were not delivered .
the new european constitution should lead to harmonisation of criminal law and procedure in our union .
my question is to commissioner wallström : i know that the european union was quite ambitious with regard to a specific objective concerning renewable energy .
faced with the enthusiasm that we are seeing throughout the world right now for our initiative - that of the european parliament , of the chairmen of our groups , the initiative that was pre-announced very specifically in strasbourg by mr watson and other members - i therefore do not understand - or , rather , i understand only too well - how it is possible to stall , at a time when france is taking the incredible step of highlighting the abolition of the death penalty with a change to its constitution ; when rwanda is also doing so ; and when , just yesterday , kyrgyzstan did so .
the european union may have begun its race towards levels of development already seen in america ' s economy and businesses , but this , the real europe , will not become a reality until the convergence of national economies and internal economic and social cohesion are given top priority .
we need free societies that feel secure in themselves .
i am certain no one in this house is in the slightest doubt as to the important role the european external action service will play in the work of the union .
i am an ardent supporter of the eu and have for a long time now wanted to see common rules within the asylum and refugee policy , but we liberals are not prepared to accept any kind of 'cordoned-off ' europe .
as rapporteur i endorse amendment 80 on the exclusion tout court of local transport , tabled by my group , but i have also indicated my support for amendment 81 , which gives member states the power to exempt local transport , provided that they guarantee passengers a similar level of rights to that set out in the regulation .
i believe this also means that it must be ensured that , when we reassemble in january , we at least know the names of the people involved before proceeding to the ballot .
the next item is the council and commission statements on the situation in georgia .
for that reason i fail to understand the misgivings that have been voiced , particularly with regard to small and medium-sized businesses , because it is precisely those firms which have the least onerous obligations in this respect .
reducing the disproportionate administrative burden will be beneficial in particular to smes managing projects in the areas of the environment , social inclusion , research , innovation or energy .
however , nothing justifies such hasty action , unless , after 1 december , the procedures carried out under the third pillar will lapse and will have to become the subject of a new procedure under the ordinary 'legislative procedure ' .
that is a requirement that can not be abandoned .
as a representative of europe 's citizens , i declare my support for mrs balzani 's report .
it is true that the liberals are the first to have tabled an amendment which aims to ensure a compromise , and which i hope can be adopted by the house tomorrow and accepted by the council .
question time ( commission )
situation in iran ( vote )
the commissioner said that this is perfectly safe and it has worked very well with white meat .
these measures favour the agro-food industry and the large distribution chains , to the detriment of smaller and medium-sized producers , and contribute to the concentration of production and an increase in the profit made by the industry , which has grown in recent years , thanks to a drop in the prices paid to milk producers and an increase in the final purchase price .
they are clearly marked by ideology .
for the very big football clubs such as manchester united in the united kingdom perhaps that is not such a motivation . but clubs such as bolton wanderers , for example , need the revenue that could come from a successful cup run and a place in europe , which is extremely lucrative , because not only does it bring participation and competition , it also brings television rights .
the presentation today of the commission 's annual programme marks the outcome of the relationship of trust between the commission and parliament .
that is not the case in china .
mr president , i voted against amendment no 5 to the lannoye report because of assurances given by the commission that it was not factually correct and that it had not asked developing countries for binding commitments in relation to privatising their water industry .
what has been done in upper austria could be done in other regions of europe , because in upper austria today only 7 % of all new houses are heated with oil .
it is astonishing that the commission chose to single out german fruit yoghurt , scotch whisky and pharmaceutical products for these cuts , apparently for no better reason than the belief that these are wealthy industries which do not deserve assistance .
that is why we have asked for national plans with clear targets that will guarantee the return of the investment .
in this way we can achieve ecological benefits and general well-being .
the joint debate on the report by marie-noëlle lienemann on behalf of the committee on the environment , public health and food safety on the proposed directive of the european parliament and of the council on community action in the field of marine environmental policy - thematic strategy on the marine environment ( marine strategy directive ) - c6 - 0346/2005 -
as far as gene transfer is concerned i believe measures must be foreseen in the new directive to control the release of gmos which can outcross with other plants .
moreover , as is rightly highlighted in the motion for a resolution under discussion today , the system must be restructured prior to the enlargement of the european union .
mr solana , you will not be a lord grey in any sense ; you are very welcome here .
student mobility programmes such as erasmus , erasmus mundus and comenius are attracting more and more candidates .
this will have two effects : one direct effect , that of encouraging the creation of jobs that are often permanent ; and one indirect effect , connected to what is produced and which could offset the loss of jobs in the primary and secondary sectors .
the second difference concerns mr brok ' s report .
indeed , the commercial concerns of these firms are incompatible with the objectives of general interest pursued by our health policies , and it would be dangerous to turn a blind eye .
within the eu there are traditional ethnic minorities which are unable to study or use their mother tongue freely , and which lack cultural or territorial autonomy .
there is something to be said for this alone .
but i want to direct some very pertinent questions to the commissioner and i hope he will answer those questions in his response .
mr president , it was a happy coincidence that the debate on tourism on today 's agenda should have taken place at this time because , by voting overwhelmingly this morning for community funding for actions in the tourism sector , the european parliament has defeated those who do not believe in a community tourism policy and has cast a vote of confidence in the political action of commissioner papoutsis . having taken over an administration suffering a lack of confidence , he is now showing signs of a new dynamic , involvement and determination .
secondly , uniform legislation must be created for the member states .
as always when i ask a question , mr david martin from the bureau replied that he knew nothing about it .
but do not let us forget that this is a solution for the future .
new services have necessitated new technologies and have also led to an increase in the number of broadcasters . as a result , the sector has been completely transformed .
a debate on the desirability of a european defence industry shows up the two-fold nature of this issue .
the debate is closed .
questions 35 to 39 will receive written answers .
the impact of a duty on the price of such shoes is therefore potentially greater than it is for ordinary shoes .
a further four defendants were also sentenced to prison and the remaining 24 have suspended sentences .
let me make it clear to everyone , however , exactly what that means - these credits are at interest rates that are perhaps around 1 % below standard market rates .
i know people often react to my speeches .
hence , we had to accomplish our discussion and texts in an extremely short period of time .
this scenario - that is , constantly evolving financial instruments such as hedge funds and derivative financial instruments - illustrates the need for further debate that takes sufficient account of consumer security .
votes
it is only with relevant information that we can make the necessary and right decisions in the environmental sector .
i voted in favour of this document because there is a need to enhance european market surveillance , provide better access to basic banking services , establish a single integrated mortgage market and remove tax obstacles and double taxation .
the peace iii programme is up and running , with eur 333 million going into an area , helping the whole infrastructure and community development in northern ireland and in the border counties .
to be very frank , when i look at the various amendments such as nos 12 and 101 , i am afraid there is a risk of a certain ambiguity towards those countries which we recommend to continue their preparations as if they were fully entitled to start the negotiations while recognizing that they are actually not sufficiently prepared .
so without a new financial perspective and without any reevaluation of the gnp ceiling , where will the money come from ?
however , i have reservations about particular elements of this report :
otherwise , the foundations of the european defence industry will be undermined .
it requires entrepreneurship , a love of nature and the environment , social orientation and perseverance .
i would particularly like to refer to what is implemented time and again by means of extraterritorial legislation .
. madam president , i can confirm that the council continues and will continue to take the view that implementation of the eight criteria laid down by the un in respect of kosovo must precede the final settlement of status .
in conclusion , i should like to say that thanks to your intervening , commissioner , important progress has been made on this directive , and i should specifically like to thank you for that .
essentially , we must achieve development models which are based on low consumption of non-renewable resources and achieve a balance between economy , ecology and social development .
we know that the energy sector which exists today is the biggest cause of greenhouse gases .
if we wanted to reduce the value of the franc , nothing could be easier .
my second point is that we must carry through to its conclusion the work already begun on establishing a common statute for members and , additionally , on clarifying the terms and conditions of employment of our parliamentary assistants , on a basis of transparency and equity and having regard to the dignity of the parliamentary function .
as european legislators we must bear in mind the importance of the health of our citizens and the protection of the diversity of nature .
the european ombudsman quite clearly represents an improvement of democracy in the eu , and he can contribute to making the eu system more transparent by giving european citizens a chance to complain when they feel badly treated .
on 31 december 1994 , directive 94/62/ec on packaging and packaging waste entered into force .
mrs green , the compromise amendment covers all the aspects raised .
we have to create an environment that is favourable to science and innovation in every corner of society : making the most of science education for our children , providing better links between schools and the workplace , designating 1996 as the year of lifelong learning , creating better research facilities for academics , financial incentives for research and innovation , and accessible scientific news for the layman .
these lists will furnish parliament with only `` yes ' members , `` ja ' and `` jawohl ' members , `` oui ' members , `` sí ' members , but no members from small countries .
yet , as the group of the european people 's party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats is proposing , there is another solution , one better adapted to the problem raised .
a second point is a premium scheme for the use of nets , which restricts additional catches . this is a truly technological improvement .
also , at a time when the eu 's main priority is employment , it would be very inconsistent to fail to take account of a crop like this , which is very labour intensive and provides jobs for women .
in our group , we find it hard to see how the financial administration for 1997 was in any crucial way better than that for 1996 .
in contrast , we believe that the gahler report has its merits , but that it is too weak and must be made bolder on a number of points .
therefore , we must welcome the commission 's wish to develop the social dialogue in these countries .
the european union must facilitate the work of the member states and continue to support its implementation .
the principle of reciprocity in tax information sharing is also in line with the agreements within the oecd and the g20 .
this situation needs to be amended as soon as possible .
neoliberalism has become the model for all of the eu 's policies , but in reality it will not solve the problem of food sufficiency anywhere in the world .
some who were entrusted to be guardians of our children have shamefully betrayed that trust .
the ambassador gave further assurances to the effect that those responsible for the attack on 21 january had been identified and would be tried ; all other persons arrested had been released .
in the 21st century this danger threatens all countries .
a number of cases in which journalists and authors have been arrested and accused of committing crimes against ‘turkishness’ have been observed .
to repeat , this was not within the community 's competence at all , but events have shown that a national approach was an obsolete approach .
apart from all that , i see these amendments as being submitted by a mean , narrow-minded individual who wants to put a spanner in the works .
why re-present the whole package now , as if nothing had happened , instead of opting for the only reasonable course ?
mr president , the aim of directive 93/75 and that of this amending directive , is to improve maritime safety and prevent accidents , enabling support action to be taken when necessary .
i hope that no-one will throw up their hands in horror if i say that whilst examining the report on echo , parliament lost faith in the anti-fraud unit .
a great deal has been said about prevention , protection and maritime borders , referring to the mediterranean .
europe puts the rebels in the south under pressure to negotiate and at the same time , americans isolate the regime and support the rebels at military level .
nevertheless , most member states are coming to realize that with drugs , combating demand is more important than combating supply .
lastly , i feel obliged to state that current pension schemes are particularly unfavourable to women , and the member states must , therefore , give priority to gender equality and european legislation that effectively guarantees the principle of non-discrimination on the grounds of gender in pension schemes must be promoted .
in 2006 , under the black sea memorandum of understanding , over 4,650 inspections of ships belonging to 83 flags were performed .
well , the least that one can say is that the programming exercise which took place there was quite strange , firstly in terms of its duration ( setting a seven year programme in two days of council meetings was perhaps risky ) and vague in terms of the amounts .
producers and member states have been called to order so that they will act quickly , particularly considering that , to date , they have had more than 12 years to comply with legislation .
the most important issue is not to punish the illegal workers from third-party states , but to penalise the employers , who are in a much stronger position .
the critical dialogue should not be there to ease our conscience , while we in the meantime keep a keen eye on our own economic interests .
these repressive measures , which violate freedom of expression , are worrying and unacceptable .
the commission is supporting quite a lot of the proposed amendments , especially those relating to stricter budget supervision ( given the possibility of retrograde political developments in the country ) and is also supporting the proposal that a final report should be delivered to parliament in the year 2004 .
the nice charter of fundamental rights of the european union has improved the definition of the content of european citizenship , which had already been introduced by the maastricht treaty .
we therefore need a parallel policy for trade measures .
i must point out that the commission is not inactive in this area and is well aware that the union has a specific role to play , particularly as regards the arrival of the euro and its development .
in writing . - ( pl ) during today 's vote i spoke in favour of adopting mr catania 's report on the situation of fundamental rights in the european union .
it has transpired that not only the fiscal instrument greatly impacts on total consumption , but that the tax level in a particular member state also has a bearing on the neighbouring countries .
i believe that just as we are on the brink of adopting this energy package we must keep in mind three challenges .
thank god !
the current crisis assailing the community 's fishing industry is sapping morale from the most important employment sector in peripheral coastal regions in this community , including my own country of ireland .
it is understandable that palestinians feel that right would have been on their side in formerly declaring an independent palestinian state on 13 september .
this , i believe , is the challenge which must unite us in the diversity of our roles , in the knowledge that those who have brought us thus far , mr president , present and past colleagues , may deserve greater respect and perhaps even a little more generosity of spirit .
this meeting should provide a good opportunity to agree on practical measures to promote stability , security and prosperity in the western balkans through the region’s progressive incorporation into the european structures , with the commission communication to which i referred earlier serving as the principal basis for this .
nevertheless , by way of an explanation of vote , i would like to make a few observations .
what is perhaps most remarkable of all , however , is how little all this is discussed by the bank ' s owners , in the member states and in the parliaments of the various member states which , i believe , are in many cases quite unaware of the bank ' s activities .
the issues of immigration and migration call for more focused discussion , and i hope that we will have the opportunity to return to them once again .
we should now break with the past and with the feeling of guilt that goes with it , in order to define a true responsible and equal partnership between the overseas countries and territories , the attached member states and the european union .
if we are to consolidate national budgets , then it is quite simply imperative that we increase tax revenues .
mr hatzidakis , i will pass on your comments on the matter of transport and road safety to mrs de palacio .
i am very pleased with the progress noted , and with the extremely positive response that our proposals have received .
if we look at the way the negotiations were handled in johannesburg - and this is another reason for its lack of success - in the first week we had a commissioner who was primarily interested in trade issues .
earlier on , we were thinking about warming up the drivers of articulated lorries , and now we have this report - i voted for it - which seeks to improve energy efficiency in the european community . it also covers all forms of energy saving such as district heating in cities - something i hope for warmly , the right word in the circumstances .
i would like to draw your attention to the fact that our competitors are not sitting back and doing nothing .
in addition , gene therapy will only be available for the most common diseases , given that the companies will not be interested in developing therapy for rare diseases which can not offer sufficient profits .
commissioner de silguy said he was prepared to talk about everything but not about the point in time at which monetary union would commence .
while this initiative is restricted to offences arising from illicit drug-trafficking on the high seas and in view of the amendments added by the rapporteur – albeit not all of them welcome , in our view – i voted in favour of this report .
as a proud scot , i would like to see a specific scottish presence in cyberspace and i believe your own country , mr president , has shown us the way with the ‘puntcat’ designation , which you so recently achieved for catalonia .
the second choice is adoption of the motion for a resolution , which would mean foregoing those advantages in return for a declaration of principle and a wish list that – i am sorry to say – can not realistically be delivered .
it is quite a small market but , and i repeat this especially for the benefit of the commission , it is the gateway to central asia , a strategic region which , as we have seen over the last few weeks , is particularly unstable .
for the european parliament , it was vital to involve as many members of the arts world as possible in the events , to instigate forms of lasting cooperation , to foster the creation and circulation of works of art , while enhancing our historic heritage and urban design , opening up initiatives to a wide-ranging public and avoiding eurocentrism by involving as many non-european cultures as possible .
once again , i tell you quite plainly : our approach - and i am saying this in the light of the discussion about echo , on which my views are also entirely personal - our approach assumes that it is only by redistributing tasks , and not by constantly supplying new staff , that one can be sure that additional expenditure is required .
well , new technology brings new challenges : considerable economic challenges .
i am very pleased to find that this report deals with the lack of transparency in the commodities sector .
with regard to cohesion , the committee states that it notes with great concern the eca 's estimate that at least 11 % of the total amount reimbursed in connection with structural policy projects should not have been reimbursed .
there too we need a hierarchy ; we need an onus to prove the need to intervene .
the grave allegations by the european people 's party made prior to the conclusion of the inquiry are to be qualified as prejudicial , and as such , on behalf of the hungarian socialist delegation , we reject them most emphatically .
first of all , improving competitiveness .
mr president , i agree of course with the comments which have been made that it would be good if we could also discuss environmental proposals at a time when more members of parliament could take part in the debate .
mr president , i can see that we have a nordic dimension to the chamber this evening .
i should like to thank mrs locatelli and express my admiration for the effort she has put into preparing this report .
we shall not forget that .
in view of this , it is crucial that integrated coastal zone management is ensured within the eu , as recommended by the european commission in a statement published on this matter .
in this way , they can make a considerable contribution to better law making .
on the one hand , a compromise had to be reached between the need to afford europe 's citizens the greatest possible degree of protection of their privacy and the concern of the operators of public telecommunications networks to provide a comprehensive and efficient service .
protection of fundamental rights in the eu , including the protection of personal data , was advanced in particular by the adoption of the charter of fundamental rights in 2000 .
there is one more thing i would like to say as what i have said so far relates to the current budgetary procedure .
i thank with all my heart all the colleagues who signed this resolution .
this can not be merely a statement of principle , and i am delighted that we have finally arrived at a proposal like the one in question .
in low-income countries the fact that testing is voluntary is a serious obstacle to combating the aids pandemic .
the debate is closed .
i have another thought on this subject : it is now clear that the commitment of the commission and the member states must not be the monopoly of the ministers for foreign affairs or of the ministers for development .
we firmly believe that a rapid and brave switch to more modern and efficient technologies will not only benefit our climate and provide the basis for a global solution , but will also be advantageous for the economy since it will make us much less dependent on imports of fossil fuels .
let me give you two examples .
the signals that the european union has sent out during the current crisis in ukraine have been highly positive .
mr rübig has the floor on a point of order .
solidarity and responsibility rightly take centre stage in this plan .
this demonstrates that when the european union sets itself clear targets and when it sets itself realistic timetables , we can achieve great things in this europe .
it is now a question of extending this requirement throughout the whole of the european union .
in the rich , democratic , developed and cohesive european union , poverty is becoming increasingly feminised .
i will bring it to the attention of my colleagues and they will provide the honourable member with the response he is seeking .
by enabling easa to impose fines for non-compliance with safety regulations , i believe we are considerably enhancing its enforcement powers .
the voters and the national parliaments are forfeiting power to mr prodi , but this power is not being picked up here in this house .
as mr mulder said , we already have a plethora of directives and legions of rules on cross-compliance .
our friendly relations , as well as harsh criticism , where necessary , could help the president to withstand a catastrophic victory by extremist fundamentalism , which in nigeria , too , is showing signs of taking root .
following on from the strengthening of bilateral cooperation with the eu , and from georgia 's participation in the council of europe and the european convention on human rights , this agreement represents another step towards improving the operation of justice and increased respect for basic freedoms by georgia .
i think this person , whether a man or a woman , will have a decisive role .
all things considered , this could be said to constitute a considerably greater environmental problem than the mining currently in operation .
there are other groups of scientists who offer different positions on climate change and its causes .
no one did .
what is special about these countries is that , until recently , the enlargement of the european union only involved countries with similar social and economic systems .
in africa , togo and burkina faso are officially the end users of arms supplied from bulgaria , whilst in reality , these are passed on to liberia and the rebels of sierra leone .
in the foreseeable future sweden will abandon nuclear energy .
no-one respects the rights of this institution more than i do myself .
mr president , i recognise that there are many issues we could discuss and there are many points in the texts in front of us with which i could take issue , but i do not want to take up too much time , and i think that these issues would be better discussed when we propose amending the directive .
the way forward for rural development is one of vision and confidence ; above all , we must look to the future !
the commission considers this to be the most cost-effective approach .
i am not interested in seeing some kind of eu-level public prosecution service set up .
mr president , i should like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report that lays down important principles .
it should , moreover , go without saying that we must not export gmos that we do not ourselves permit within the european union .
the royal mail told me this very week that it does not want it , as it would be bad for small businesses , charities and customers .
it is high time , therefore , that all states in the region understand that such projects can not be seen as an old-style fight over spheres of influence , and i share the view of the commissioner that the goal is to achieve more stability and security in our neighbourhood .
there is also an external aspect to this problem : the international community , mr president , must be united in its rejection of terrorism and of violence .
it is important for the eu not only to speak politically with one voice but also to have available the necessary security policy instruments in order to take peace-keeping or peace-making measures , for the purposes of crisis prevention , whether it be in albania or kosovo .
i wish to work with them rather than against them and hope that you share this view .
( the sitting was suspended at 11.55 a.m. and resumed at 12.00 noon )
where the arms are likely to be used , for example , for internal repression or external aggression , then those arms sales should not take place .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , a spirit is abroad in europe .
alternatively , let me draw a comparison between the united states and europe . the americans have gone in exactly the opposite direction .
but our parliament has tied this aid to certain conditions and now we have to ensure that these conditions are met .
secondly , we would like to see action to ensure that all containers are correctly weighed in port and correctly stowed before a ship sets sail for sea , as well as fitting automated beacons to aid container location .
so we are in complete agreement with mr florenz on the need for a framework directive which integrates and simplifies current legislation , above all if account is taken of the fact that non-compliance with community law on environmental issues is habitual .
the agreement will be applied by parties , in their capacities as port states , for vessels not entitled to fly their flags , while seeking entry to ports or while they are in port .
i believe the majority of the s & d group will find those compromises acceptable to them .
i must emphasise that the ban on the use of drift nets could cause the premature cessation of activity for certain fishermen , as the proposed measures provide for the establishment of an additional compensatory payment in the event of cessation of all fishing activity before 1 january 2002 .
last week 's proposals for reform in portugal had some positive recommendations for improving competitiveness , but the situation in greece seems dire .
immigration is not a problem .
they represent a small but significant strand of public opinion and of course they should take part in our debates .
it is my view that the member states are perhaps slower to implement common rules of this kind than we realise .
on behalf of the pse group . - ( de ) madam president , the right to unrestricted education , which means the right of access to education , is enshrined in the charter of fundamental rights , and yet it is still deficient and has still not been fully realised in practice .
b5-0644/2001 by mr hughes and others , on behalf of the pse group ;
my concern here is not just that compensation should be paid quickly - which has not happened at all in the past - but that a code of practice should be accepted by all members of the council .
today the terrorist threat is greater and it will not disappear for the time being .
the good intentions of the amendments outweigh the negatives , however , and we have therefore chosen to support the amendments in their entirety .
however , with a referendum taking place in ireland next week , i felt that it would not be appropriate to participate in this vote as it is broader than the text of the treaty itself .
i would like to know what mr brittan thinks about this .
at the same time , throughout the world , people are condemning a type of economic development that does not go hand in hand with social development and the communication itself notes that 'market governance has developed more quickly than social governance ' .
next , a plan must be drawn up to scrap 4 000 boats that you yourself deem to be at risk , commissioner , which means ship yards must now focus on constructing and developing modern and safe ships .
unless the common foreign policy is to be devoid of any practical sense , it should seek to achieve a minimum level of security for all member states , rather than to promote the interests of individual countries .
our key objective should not be to advocate biodiversity as an end in itself , but to protect a development model that enables people to enjoy the highest possible quality of life , which is only possible if ‘natural’ space is preserved and maintained .
the european union should finally have a real dimension .
being intelligent sometimes means waiting .
you deceived me there , ana .
please forgive me , then , if i disagree with your approach on this point .
i hope that the current economic austerity will encourage states to spend their resources more intelligently and that they will be capable of cooperating more effectively .
member of the commission . - ( cs ) the un convention on the rights of persons with disabilities was completed during the luxembourg presidency , thanks , too , to the coordinated endeavours of the european union .
madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i think that we are all agreed that lifelong learning is an important political tool and i would like to thank mrs van brempt for not pulling her punches .
last year , this was the subject of an extensive debate here , and you noticed that we made it very clear this year in the report that it is desirable for the european central bank to play a role in this supervision .
. mr president , thank you .
the report itself illustrates what these calls for equality and dignity are worth , as it would like to increase the fight against illegal immigration on the basis that it considers this to be the source of workers who are deprived of their rights and subjected to unacceptable conditions of employment and exploitation .
. i confirm that we are unquestionably committed to bringing the european union closer to its citizens .
i would like to end by drawing your attention to the fact that vdrs and transponders are not in themselves sufficient to avoid accidents . other factors such as the level of training and the competence of the crew are equally as important .
that is why substances which destroy the ozone layer need to be replaced with alternative substances as quickly as possible .
to conclude the debate on this statement i have received a motion for a resolution b5-0527/2002 , pursuant to rule 37 of the rules of procedure , on behalf of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy .
mrs haug ' s report contains a proposal whereby a report on amending the system should be drafted before 2004 .
the oral question and the motion for a resolution on unesco follows on from parliament 's report and resolution on the safeguarding and promotion of cultural diversity and the role of the european region , and the international organisations such as unesco and the council of europe .
finally , we need a little bit of luck as well , for perception of this recovery is necessary for all these initiatives to be effective .
however , if injustices have taken place , then they must be investigated .
it must also be in conformity with the community 's international obligations , including word trade organisation rules .
this is also the reason why we are drawing the commission ' s attention to this issue this evening , in itself not a very appropriate time .
eu ministers for social affairs have acknowledged that 120 million european citizens live below the poverty line .
the omissions of many years must be dealt with in the short term if we wish to retain our prosperity .
decisions must be taken on the performance of the applicant country .
if , on the other hand , our 27 countries which , admittedly , still have substantial disparities in terms of wealth and a priori different industrial and energy backgrounds , and different climates too , manage to agree on a public process that can be assessed , verified and financed , thereby setting in motion an historic change in trends , then i believe that this will fill us with hope for copenhagen and for the future of our planet .
these components are common targets , common indicators , guidelines , common indicators , a summary report , national reports and recommendations .
it is not a court of law able to hand down decisions on penalties or compensation .
firstly , we wish to keep in line with the resolutions that the european parliament adopted in december last year , whereby it was particularly expressed that such an agreement would be desirable .
innovations can help to create new jobs and entire industries , but the opposite can also be the case .
we can of course see that as a positive sign , an indication of political competition , but it can also be seen as evidence that there is much still to be desired as regards political culture .
as there are doubts , would it not be more advisable , from a political point of view , to put the reform of the legal system on the igc agenda , and incorporate these proposals into the more general reform of the union ' s legal system along the lines of what is being requested for the european public prosecutor ?
mr president , we are at the end of the mandate of the commission and parliament and therefore , on this occasion , i would like to congratulate commissioner monti on the excellent work he has done throughout the mandate of this commission .
on this subject , i will be quite plain : there is still a lot to do , particularly on energy efficiency , the diversification of energy sources , the interconnections , the development of infrastructure , cooperation with the big supplier countries , transit countries and the major consumers .
these are very complicated scientific issues .
mr president , whilst others may say what happened at the lisbon summit was shocking , i am of the firm belief that the elected representatives that are the governments of the peoples of the member states of the european union are entitled to defend what they see as the rights of their people within that union .
( nl ) mr president , according to our voting lists , amendment 9 will lapse if amendment 21 , tabled by the group of the european people 's party ( christian democrats ) , is adopted .
the framework decision on the european arrest warrant , the legality of which is open to question , undermines the sovereign rights of the member states and contradicts articles 5 ( 2 ) , 6 and 7 of the greek constitution .
with that purpose in mind , it is being proposed that the central and eastern europe loan envelope be increased by eur 350 million .
i am therefore grateful to parliament for the contribution that it has already made and is yet to make to this work of ours .
the commission has unfolded a number of initiatives .
i think it likely that it will not be an easy route to take .
the next item is the report ( a4-0065/98 ) by mr cornelissen , on behalf of the committee on transport and tourism , on the communication from the commission `` promoting road safety in the eu - the programme for 1997-2001 ' ( com ( 97 ) 0131 - c4-0180/97 ) .
the outcome of this consultation will steer the commission 's planning for the future legislative proposal .
with reference to the simplified procedure , i have to stress that the implementation of legal requirements and transparency of decision making by national authorities must be ensured .
the best way to prevent the transmission of encephalopathies is to promote the controlled production of milk and beef . such production would be based on local pasture and fodder .
i want to thank you for your support in this regard .
a healthy free market economy is one of the key characteristics of a democracy , and it is here that the greatest challenge facing our eastern neighbours lies .
there is one last point which we consider particularly important at this juncture , namely the introduction of the euro .
we welcome the idea of some sort of stakeholder forum where companies can bounce ideas off each other and share best practice , but do not see this as a forum which will lead to the signing-up of agreements .
if you are not able to provide the house with that information , can i ask you to clarify it ?
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , during the meeting held in pyongyang between 25 and 27 november of last year within the framework of the political dialogue , the european troika emphasised the most important parts of the european union ' s strategies towards the democratic people ' s republic of korea - strategies which had been approved by the council at its meetings on 9 october and 20 november .
i add my voice to this expression of sympathy to the millions of ukrainians that suffered this calamity and , in particular , to the relatives of those who died as a result of this artificial famine .
we need to know how far eu member states have implemented the action programme of the 13 practical steps agreed in 2002 at the npt review conference .
that , of course , is in the nature of compromise texts .
more stringent requirements must also be in place with regard to defending jobs and regional development in forthcoming regulations on community funds .
tolerance means peaceful coexistence through respecting the convictions of the other while maintaining one 's own .
i am delighted that you are planning a letter , and i shall make it a duty and a pleasure to answer it point by point , mr coûteaux , particularly about catching you on the hop for the vote yesterday .
she obtained a printed notice of her pension entitlement , and learned that she could expect dm 1 , 130.00 per month .
our group believes that the european parliament , and the european union itself , can play an important role in the peace process in columbia by adding an international dimension to the support for the process and by providing whatever help might be of use to the parties involved .
however , to ensure that this middle way really does feed into the justice and home affairs policy , we are calling for more control rights for this parliament and for the national parliaments in the eu as part of the implementation of the stockholm programme .
better preparation , of course , also entails institutional reforms and consolidation of the european union .
this is extremely useful , and we should all make use of it .
( pt ) the european union 's policies and actions in several areas frequently contradict stated development aid objectives .
people are dying daily because they are caught up in a drug underworld which is making millions from their misery .
it must work across the borders of member states , so that victims will not have to start the entire judicial process required to obtain protection measures afresh if they move to another member state .
i have heard it said that preference is given to questions which are related to a particular commissioner and this is quite right .
for reasons to do with the general interest , health , morality and security , these services need to be regulated and controlled .
not until 2007 at the earliest will emu be enlarged by more than 15 members .
however , i hope that we still adopt the better parts of the committee on the environment report when we vote tomorrow .
the initial reports were , of course , fairly critical .
however , we hope that we will see a different attitude adopted by the european commission in future because it is not normal for european farmers to always lose out as a result of commercial agreements .
secondly , it must be objective .
we very much doubt it .
there is an unambiguous link between human trafficking and prostitution .
let me give you just two reasons for this .
i should like first to comment on the broad economic policy guidelines .
in discussions with the commission , the enterprises in the sector welcomed the fact that the aid regulation in favour of european beekeeping was to be maintained .
this programme takes into account the guidelines featured in the kok and marimon reports and especially the locatelli report , which was presented by the european parliament at the start of 2005 .
what does more europe mean ?
the fact that he is portuguese and my loyalty to the group of the european people 's party ( christian democrats ) prevent me from voting against .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , numerous speakers have stressed the importance of this environment directive .
the presidency has given mrs boudjenah very satisfactory answers , not just on the subject of the code of conduct for arms but also regarding the conflict in the sahara . the president-in-office of the council is well aware that mrs boudjenah ' s question arises out of her concern about the conflict between morocco and western sahara .
you only have to take a closer look at it in order not to swallow what the lobbyists in the corridors are trying to delude you into believing .
i welcome the suggestion that dr ibrahim rugova , who was awarded the sakharov prize by this house , should come and address us in june for as long as is necessary .
this is something i fail to understand , mr president .
if europe is to match the united states economically , we need to create a single capital market ; otherwise borrowing will also be more expensive here , which in turn inevitably favours the united states .
the country 's human rights situation is one of the grimmest in africa and mugabe 's government is plunging the country into ever deeper despair .
mr president , there is no reason to doubt the good democratic and legal policy aspects that are behind these reports and , in particular , the recommendation on the future development of europol .
for goodness ' sake , we do not have to standardise curriculum vitae forms , which differ from country to country , but it is a help which we very often need to give our young workers for their careers .
( applause )
that is why we commend the amendments .
nonetheless it has a relatively simple objective : to harmonise procedures governing the authorisation of feed additives .
we will naturally present this study to parliament and the council and where necessary we will draw up the relevant proposals in accordance with it .
madam president , i should like to raise a point which i think is of enormous concern to the people of the european union and that is the reports which have come out this morning about the decision by the british government last night to end the cull of british cattle believed or suspected to be infected with bse .
korea will need to changes its domestic regulations to comply with these commitments , whereas no such change would be needed in europe .
commissioner , can you answer 'yes ' or 'no ' as to whether you intend to do this ?
we can not endorse this directive as matters stand , because it would lead to a dramatic increase in family reunification , which is one of the main grounds for reunification .
i do not believe that any member of the commission or the council , or even of this very house , should be expected to address the house in the conditions that mrs reding faced just now .
the conditions for organising and conducting the observer mission have yet to be established .
nor should we be deceived by the almost automatic transition to the new millennium .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
the european council conclusions highlighting the hague programme take account of the recommendation on the use of qualified majority voting and the codecision procedure adopted by the european parliament on 14 october 2004 .
amendment no 13 can be accepted except for the reference to cn code 3814 0090 in the definition of non-agricultural alcohol because that code covers mixtures of alcohol with solvents and is not limited to non-agricultural alcohol .
next year , european politics must manage to identify long-term prospects for the eu and , in cooperation with the general public , limit the adverse effects that the crisis in the financial market is having on the entire european economy .
on the contrary , his road to power is paved with various measures that prove the opposite to be true .
it is therefore essential that the debt of developing countries is cancelled , so that they can build a fairer world .
madam commissioner , i did not understand all the technical details you mentioned but i imagine your services will know more about them than we do .
it is also about citizens ' confidence and belief that food quality is everything it should be .
regarding production standards , article 20 of the gatt allows governments to act regarding trade in order to protect human , animal or plant life or health , provided they do not discriminate or use this as disguised protectionism .
in confronting the challenge of integrating roma communities , the major responsibility falls on national authorities , in addition to the regional and local authorities with the largest number of roma inhabitants .
a definitive decision is currently being taken in this multi-disciplinary working group about all the subjects which can and should be dealt with .
the european globalisation adjustment fund ( egaf ) aims to support workers personally affected by redundancies resulting from major changes in world trade .
the debate is closed .
i congratulate mrs. flautre for this report .
it is important to see the benefit to the member states of investment and of developing the systems so that they are completed on schedule .
on the minus side , an indicator of the lack of knowledge of eu citizens is the fact that almost four out of five complaints do not fall within the scope of responsibilities of the european ombudsman .
we do not want the 'clash of civilisations ' , we want peace in freedom and justice among all nations and beliefs .
the next item is the vote .
anti-corruption legislation forms part of this .
we have , to the best of our ability , voted in favour of better animal husbandry .
he has done a lot of work to promote this idea , listened to the various parties and achieved a good end result .
while the commissioner thinks that this kind of legislation is not often covered by the press , i have to say that this particular issue is indeed covered by the press ; it is something that people genuinely care about and there is an element of justice that has to be recognised in this .
we want them to be harmonised , not least because the citizens of the european union want that .
the neverending story is now becoming reality .
on behalf of the alde group . - ( et ) commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , there seems to be a symbolic significance to our discussing light-sensitive issues on a dark night .
however , that proves that there is room for the two sides to meet half way , if they can agree on the cut-off point and the benchmarks for assessing saddam hussein 's credibility .
i also asked about the waste ...
his realistic approach has in any event generated a few specific building blocks to develop further .
certain asian countries are experiencing tremendous growth , and the eu itself has also become much larger .
at the present time , many beef cattle farmers are thinking of ploughing up pastureland to produce cereals or other crops .
it is , however , no secret that the multi-annual budgets for this type of policy - an internal policy - has a very low ceiling .
the implementation of such measures must be coordinated with the socrates ii and leonardo programmes .
i think any amendments have to be considered very carefully , because they might have complex repercussions .
we can only hope to find a solution to the conflict by keeping the diplomatic route open .
i do , however , support the creation of a post of commissioner for human rights and minorities , who would also be responsible for protecting the rights of children .
there are always new timetables , more percentages , new regulations and stipulations .
if russia wishes to present itself as being a democratic country , then it must fall in with the community of values of europe and uphold democracy and human rights .
reducing government debt must continue to be our top priority .
i am extremely concerned that after the moluccas this anti-christian force should have found its way to sulawesi too .
the idea of energy taxation as a supplement to the agreements that have been reached with regard to emissions trading has been mooted before .
they face the biggest attack since the end of the second world war ...
that was a direct reference to the british government .
mr president , speaking about issues which concern the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , i should like to start with the issues touched on by commissioner barnier , the issues of regional policy , and to say here that , as far as the previous period from 1994 to 1999 is concerned , as he himself admitted , developments are not the most propitious .
we feel that the european parliament must play a central role and that its commitment is very important in terms of further strengthening the european legal framework of measures to combat trafficking in human beings .
i would add that the commission will be present in the governing bodies of the authorities and that , in this regard , it will , of course , be vigilant so as to ensure that any decision that is taken in the interest of the union .
mr president , although the laboratory directive was not adopted until 1990 and has not yet been transposed in many member states , the commission has already made a proposal providing for massive deregulation and a drop in environmental and safety standards .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i am grateful to mr barton for his excellent report on this proposal for a directive on the masses and dimensions of certain categories of motor vehicles and their trailers .
we are in no position to ignore these factors when discussing plant protection regulations .
the european food safety authority will not become an unwieldy giant but will hopefully soon provide us with sound and reliable scientific advice .
in this spirit , the nomination of the individuals of which it is composed must be governed by capability and independence criteria .
in consultations and negotiations on the complex matters of personnel policy , it is natural of course that some delays have been experienced .
it will also provide stability in investments , allow manufacturers to predict movements , strengthen innovation and result in greater investment in research and development .
in the enlarged europe , after bulgaria and romania have joined it , there will be 8 million roma and sinti , living in social conditions that are extremely difficult , and more difficult than in many member states .
some are due to the crisis per se , which started last spring .
this has been proven very clearly once again .
of course , the united states had a role as guarantor of the process of peace and democratic reconstruction in post-war europe .
previous speakers have already kindly pointed this out .
this is unacceptable : if a substance is hazardous , it is hazardous .
this is not acceptable and we need to introduce urgent changes .
nevertheless , we think there is reason to be hopeful about these death sentences , insofar as no death sentence has been carried out in 1998 .
since , following the green paper , we have agreed that contracting authorities have a right to set environmental standards if they so wish , we need to know exactly how they can implement those rights without breaching the overriding rules on competition .
as you will recall , these points of reference are described in detail in the new guidelines for phare that were sent to your parliament in march .
similarly , the production under licence by eu countries in third countries is another one of such issues .
previously , parliaments looked to the commission to take the lead : as the guardian of the treaties ; as the motor of integration , the initiator of ideas .
we welcome all this , but why has it taken so long ?
today we complete the parliamentary procedure on a report which has had a very bumpy ride .
while i believe that president barroso means well , i find it regrettable that neither poland nor slovakia has ever received such extraordinary sums of money for job creation , despite having the highest levels of unemployment in the european union .
various studies have shown that robert owen was right : working longer than eight hours is counterproductive .
secondly , the creation of better conditions for development and macroeconomic balance , an effort which will involve both the inter-american development bank and the european investment bank .
we have to implement measures that allow belarus to find a path to democracy .
when that time comes , when we have used up all our resources , i shall not hesitate to come here before you to request further resources , but what i am saying now is that if we are not given these necessary resources , we shall have to refuse to take on any new duties because the available resources will not be commensurate with the new tasks that we will be taking on .
maybe what we are looking at here is a new definition of a ‘safe’ third country , at least in terms of its information .
the last point i would make is on the question of the definition of the family .
thank you , mr de rossa .
- before the vote :
i would like to reiterate that the commission is of the opinion that the european union should support the mexican resolution on protecting human rights in the context of the fight against terrorism , in the 60th session of the un commission on human rights .
the egf is not a replacement for actions that are the responsibility of firms under national legislation or collective agreements , nor does it finance the restructuring of firms or sectors .
i was in tunisia recently , where i met not only with the government and the president of the republic , but also with representatives of civil society , women 's organisations and trade unions .
secondly , non-coastal countries , such as the czech republic , austria , slovakia and hungary , are at a disadvantage when it comes to competition for tendering .
could the commission please comment on these intentions of mr raffarin 's so-called 'government of action ' ?
( the minutes were approved )
at the present time , without quotas , many countries in europe already devote more than 60 % of screen time to european productions .
at that stage in the crisis , the union 's particular contribution consisted on one hand of offering humanitarian aid , in particular food and medicine and , on the other , in contributing to the reestablishment of the albanian police force and supporting the electoral process , a key point in the international effort .
we do not want to be lectured about our employment practices when we enforce the law , even if it is inconvenient , by countries which bang the drum for enforcement and then go through the back door to ensure that the law is not enforced .
above all , i agree with the compromise because it respects the subsidiarity principle and is less burdensome for local authorities .
things have not improved since our last resolution ; quite the opposite .
at the same time , we share the views expressed by the members in their resolution that vietnam should continue in its efforts to improve protection for civil , political and religious rights .
be that as it may , will you be evaluating the answers given to you ?
.
in addition , the rapporteur is right in pointing out that both the commission and the member states can each in their own way contribute to the development of cities : the commission by monitoring the side effects general economic and regional policy have on cities , and member states by drawing up development plans for their cities and urban areas .
the commission 's proposal seeks to close a loophole , and that is to be welcomed .
we need capacity and speed .
while i approve this treaty change i have very serious concerns regarding the current economic governance proposals , and voting in favour of this report is not an endorsement of the current economic governance package .
we therefore recommend amendments 4 and 5 , tabled by mr mulder , whereby compensation paid to farmers in connection with the bse crisis would be funded on an equal ( 50-50 ) basis by the eu and the member states .
but the situation in the united states is quite different from the situation in europe and sometimes i get the impression that the european central bank is giving in slightly to market expectations and appeasing the markets with increases of 25 or 50 points and i worry somewhat when i read reports by financial analysts predicting increases of over 100 points by the end of the year .
i should like to know whether you consider the mention in the final act to be adequate , and why it was impossible to grant the wish of the european churches and enshrine this relationship in the treaty itself as well .
once these data are available , the commission will consider how best we can contribute further to international efforts .
the aim is to strengthen the union by allowing the member states to have a greater involvement and increasingly to pool their currently separate efforts in relation to the cfsp .
where is the beef ?
the commission has opted for harmonisation and has put forward a proposal for a directive that valiantly tackles the delicate task of approximating twelve laws with many different points and introducing legislation in three countries that do not have this system .
yes , mr beazley , but after mr paisley , who had requested the floor first .
often dichloromethane is used by individuals carrying out restoration work in their own homes . they find it to be an excellent and effective product , but do not realise that by using it in an enclosed space they risk losing consciousness very quickly , and that there is even a risk of death if due care is not taken .
in writing . - claude turmes ' report on the global energy and renewable energy fund ( geeref ) is one that i endorse .
we have achieved a great deal already .
we need a progressive approach - in other words , sanctions are not going to be lifted overnight - and a conditional approach , in that the eu will react to positive signals from the regime , as well as an approach geared towards the welfare of civil society , as mr severin said .
these courses could even be financed out of the training funds .
in this regard i consider mr sterckx 's report , for which i had the honour of being the rapporteur 's auxiliary , to be a particularly good one .
the images of devastation and suffering have been shown all over the world and no one has remained indifferent .
we call on the ethiopian government to release all political prisoners immediately and unconditionally .
in fact , to my mind , ports do not merely have a commercial role but are also tools for developing employment and regional planning .
the countries of europe are getting themselves ever deeper into debt in order to restart their economies .
i am indeed of the opinion that he was a sound commissioner for the union .
recent events have demonstrated that what we hold to be stable and permanent within our own countries , within the community of fifteen , may , in certain circumstances , turn out to be much less helpful than we might hope in terms of addressing problems that are often quite simple , but in other cases revive old ghosts .
even though this is hard to say , russia must be judged on its choices , on what it is and on what it wants to be , without excessive alarm but also without complacency .
commissioner mandelson and russian trade minister gref also put forward their views at the summit .
we do not , however , consider it useful to include an issue of this type on an agenda of a different nature , such as the meetings of asean , since we do not believe it to be appropriate to raise this issue in high-level multilateral meetings .
adjournment of the session
the 1999 constitution of venezuela was a perfect opportunity to strengthen the rule of law and guarantee human rights in this country .
i supported this particular report because other sectors need to get involved and share the efforts .
it is something that should be decided by the meps themselves .
and that is what is important : a society with low carbon emissions .
of course , ensuring the cohesion and the perspective of such interventions in the city belongs to the national , and chiefly to the municipal , authorities which , in athens , for example , have not done their job , beyond a short-lived push forward for political reasons .
i hope that parliament will pay more attention to pensioners and the elderly , at least as much attention as it pays to packaging , which - and this is good news - the european parliament sees as so useful : let us hope that the pensioners and elderly people of all the individual states as well as the european state will be considered to be this useful .
we are therefore proposing to amend the regulations as follows .
therefore , i welcome the increase both in regionalisation and controls , and i hope that , in the future , the contributions for the export of live animals will be abolished .
as commissioner verheugen said , market failure is something that directly affects the union 's citizens .
children must get to grips with proper eating habits in terms of the quality and quantity of food and laying the table .
that is what this statute is about !
so let the 450 million vote on the treaty .
g20 finance ministers discussed at length the treatment of impaired assets less than two weeks ago .
we must ensure that consumers have a well-founded sense of security when shopping on the internal market and that , even when they end up in dispute , they can easily get help and redress .
indeed , court of auditors reports tell us that in recent times the checks on agricultural expenditure have greatly improved .
i will not go so far as to say that everything depends on the european union , but without determination and credibility , as mrs joly has just mentioned , nothing will be achieved in this area .
the conclusion of the banning treaty in ottawa will be a great achievement .
now we need a resurrection of leftist thinking in europe .
when i visited brittany , i appreciated for myself that there was a need for a unit , or specialists , with responsibility for cleaning and washing birds affected by oil slicks .
we also think that between now and enlargement we should update the budgetary procedure and the own resources system , to make them fairer and more transparent to the european public .
this would be achieved by him withdrawing his troops and paramilitary services , to give the necessary guarantees for the security of these people , based on his acceptance of an international military presence on the ground .
we are going to end up with what we are already starting to witness ; a veritable , suicidal immigration of entire populations , organised by member states and european institutions alike .
too many moments when something could have been done and it was not .
but if you are going to quote , make sure it is complete .

there is therefore a need to merge competition and media legislation in order to guarantee access , competition and quality .
we want to respond to further requests from syria for assistance in the reform process .
allow me to start with the latter point .
we also feel that programming over a ten-year period is much too long , to the point at which theory has prevailed over practice in the commission communication , a document of 90 pages no less .
to that extent i must again , being logical , reject it .
the maritime border surveillance system has been presented as a model of good practice .
he has worked very hard to ensure that we are able to discuss these proposed amendments to the general regulation today , after they have passed so quickly through all the institutional stages , and also , i hope , to enable us adopt them shortly in parliament with a broad majority , so that the relevant items can be implemented quickly .

i said to many people who questioned me : do n't do it .
the treaty of lisbon has been ratified and must enter into force as soon as possible .
but the eu will remain dependent on imported protein .
compulsory modulation and gradual modulation are less brutal than in the commission 's proposal .
nanotubes may behave in the human body in a manner similar to asbestos fibres .
therefore , we ask the commission and the council to immediately begin a tripartite dialogue on this issue during which the three institutions will set a specific , stable and sufficient budgetary action line .
in gaza , the troika met president arafat .
we therefore believe that it is inappropriate to react to isolated studies , and that the eu should wait for the imminent completion of the who 's major evaluation project , amongst others , before embarking on legislation dealing with possible long-term effects .
i am therefore glad that the european commission has proposed creating an intermediate category for regions where gdp per capita is between 75 and 90 % of the eu average .
– mr president , nepal , one of the poorest countries in asia , has had a very troublesome recent history not least because of the rebellion by powerful maoist forces , which has been going on for the last nine years . in this period more than 11 000 people have been killed .
the sectors to which we , the commission and parliament , had , in 2003 , held out the hope of a reduced vat rate – the hotel and catering industry , the building industry , but also laundries and garden maintenance businesses – all these sectors remain wanting .
the council or the member states have a right to be consulted , but they do not have a right to co-decision .
despite what is being done , i think we can all agree that we must work together and enhance our collective performance in fighting against terrorism .
three people were killed and many more have horrendous injuries which , in many cases , will leave them scarred and disabled for the rest of their lives .
the irb approach should be designed prudently but in such a way as not to unduly exclude smaller and less complex institutions .
that , at any rate , is the feedback we have received from the numerous local discussions that we have organized .
once again , as a reformist , i believe that the right path is the middle way : preventing restructuring is an idle dream .
this amendment no 36 falls into block 3 and the deadline for the submission of technical amendments or corrections expired at midday on tuesday ; in fact , when i asked you if it was possible to include separate votes , yesterday at 6.30 p.m. , i was rightly told that the deadline had expired .
and here , reverting very specifically to matters on which we have previously focused , whether there will not be a special effort to harmonize the taxation of capital , and deposits in particular ?
i should like to make myself very clear : we do not require two calls for competition simply because we believe that that is unnecessary .
( el ) mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , i should like to congratulate mrs angelilli on her exceptional work on such a sensitive issue which concerns us all .
madam president , i thank mr pettinari for this excellent report .
mr president , i would also like to say thank you for a very interesting and rewarding debate on the third pillar and what has taken place during the past year .
this will reduce the chances of finding a decent life in europe .
in fact i think that this report is at least as important as the content of the fifth framework programme .
importantly , given that shipping is a global industry , the main element of the proposal is aligned with internationally-agreed rules set out in the international maritime organisation 's air pollution convention , that is , marpol , annex vi .
the purpose of this directive is to reinforce safety and ensure the free movement of such equipment within the union , by setting out clear , transparent and mandatory rules for safely transporting pressure equipment in all the member states , standardising the procedures throughout the eu .
in addition , all the institutions are called upon to intensify their efforts to achieve economy and efficiency .
if we achieve that growth rate over the next seven years in europe , we will have no problem with any aspect of funding .
a co2 tax applied to all polluters should be used to reduce other taxes and applied equally to all sectors , for example agriculture and smelting .
it would be suicide , as today others have repeatedly advocated , to think that european leaders can put pressure on the central bank so that it will make up for their inability to relaunch the economy through structural reforms , liberalisation of the markets - the job market first and foremost - and tight budgetary policy which must be coupled with a reduction of the tax burden on people and firms .
tell him to get the rating report because he will certainly run faster than me , being a moscow olympic runner , and he will , therefore , get to present it and get it adopted before parmalat collapses’ .
as mr pęk rightly said , we are pouring truckloads of money into a doomed project and causing huge damage to ourselves , to european economies and to our children and grandchildren .
let us go back to the basics : it began with john locke and his concept of human rights based on life , freedom and property . this was translated by the americans into life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness and taken up by the united nations in its call for life , liberty and security of the person .
a single farm is concerned , and i am happy to say that he informed me that all of the animals moved from that farm before confirmation had been slaughtered .
in these circumstances the decision taken by the ecb to raise by 25 basis points to 4.25 % the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations of the eurosystem is welcome and should be congratulated !

'certain requirements ' is the wording on which the whole comitology system is based .
obviously , greece is also requested to further pursue efforts to improve the collection and processing of general government aid .
the success of the euro-mediterranean project and the concrete results of economic cooperation between the european union and the countries of the area should benefit the peace policy .
the europe we need is community-oriented rather than intergovernmental .
the latest one from the committee against torture makes the point again : that torture techniques , which should be abhorrent to any decent person , are still being used .
we seemed to have spent a lot of time debating amongst ourselves , rather than debating with others , on a day-by-day basis and we ended up being soundly thrashed .
the principle of solidarity will be implemented and this too is an important political point .
i would like to thank the three questioners very much for presenting in detail the considerations which led them to formulating the questions .
( de ) mr president , thank you for the warning .
timing has always been vital in this area , and it still is .
at the same time , the ambitious enlargement of the union to meet half the continent’s aspirations for freedom , security and democracy meant that we had to be equally ambitious in dealing with the overhaul of our institutional set-up .
since the completion of the internal market and as a result of increasing mobility , which is also linked to international migration patterns , the number of binational life-partnerships is increasing , but so are the cases of conflict .
the commission sincerely hopes that the european parliament will support its efforts to make progress in these important fields .
at the same time , there is agreement that the ceiling for the administrative expenditure in 2003 should be retained .
the basic principle here is that the rules of the council lay down that the president-in-office represents the position of the council and that , as the person to hold that position , i am therefore presenting the position of the council and replying on its behalf .
therefore , the fact that i voted , and particularly that i voted in such a way , should be deleted .
mr president , ‘those who die are lucky’ : those are the words of a palestinian woman i met in gaza last week who has worked for 20 years for peace and for women’s rights in that area .
naturally , sweden and the other countries neighbouring the baltic have a great interest in the strategy for the area , but we also believe it could serve as a model for other regions and other regional strategies that would be useful to the entire eu .
the figures presented in the report amply demonstrate this body 's efficiency and its importance for the transparency of relations between the european institutions and the public .

the house has imposed a sanction , which mr rosado fernandez has accepted .
at the same time , russia is , without a doubt , an important strategic partner for europe , and not only in terms of energy supply .
this is a problem and we hope that the skilled and motivated people in bochum will soon find work again .
we have research funds to put into industries for the complete redesign and reconfiguration of processes .
we now have an opportunity to go further down that route .
but there is another factor in play and that is product information .
in addition , the proposed directive reinforces the control of posted workers because it establishes a system of cooperation between member states and obliges the country of origin of the service provider to assist the authorities of the host member state in the supervision of working conditions .
i thank all the authors of the resolution , including my slovak colleague irena belohorská , for their efforts , without which we would have not found the answers to serious issues related to this aggressive disease .
( the president cut the speaker off )
i would make this number one on the list of priorities and , in fact , i regard a peace dividend for the environment and for the bushmeat crisis as one of the many important aspects for securing peace in the drc and elsewhere in the region .
we also support institutional reforms affecting the south .
but i argued that the proposals were not demanding enough .
mr president , it is pleasant to renew acquaintance in this forum with mr pearson , who served with effect for some time in northern ireland , as did commissioner mandelson .
in my opinion , only then will the possibility exist of bringing about a relative degree of stability in the region .
mr solana will be making a contribution and will include a report on the eu-russia summit . this matter could be dealt with under this heading .
the understanding that has just been reached , therefore , is not indifferent , in the framework of the current budgetary rules , to the flexibility that is crucial to the correct implementation of the growth and stability pact .
on this point , we think that a broad and comprehensive political debate should take place about the desired level of ambition and the financial resources available .
( nl ) mr president , i too voted against the resolution on extremism .
the regulations will oblige airports with more than five million passengers to make their fees transparent and to justify their costs .
no doubt in some quarter , such activity is even viewed as deserving of a bonus .
so you have no cause for concern .
the sis ii system will enable the schengen area to be enlarged to cover the new member states as quickly as possible , by updating it , increasing its capacity and introducing the new possibilities offered by the most recent technological developments .
( lt ) the european commission and members of the wto are rushing to finalise the doha talks on agriculture and the opening of the market for industrial goods , nama .
the member states have indicated that they have found it difficult to apply article 55 efficiently .
were we to call that into question , even once , it would set a precedent that would be followed by many more , each more dangerous than the last .
there are therefore two amendments which are particularly problematic ; those concerning practising doctors and those concerning sunday as a rest day .
i think he was entirely right in his comments but i think we should have the full rich tapestry of this house recorded rather than some sanitized version that suits us if we want to look holier than thou .
implementation is important , as some people have touched on – in amendment 5 for example , concerning youth unemployment and as regards women in the workplace – but we also have to look at the issue of older workers , the rapidly ageing population of working age .
this issue is very dear to our hearts .
lastly let me say this : we have two thousand tonnes of weapon-grade plutonium and uranium in the world , and that is bad .
mr president , may i express the gratitude of the commission for mrs randzio-plath 's remarks .
they must be assessed by parliament and should be made legally binding .
the debate is closed .
finally , this autumn sees commissioner potočnik embarking on a roadmap for research infrastructure , which should reveal which regions , areas or clusters really do have the potential to meet the challenge of global competition .
the food safety programme is of particular importance , since it provides seeds , tools and all the necessary elements for alternative crops .
so in future , i will always speak in another language and i will also listen in other languages .
i can only warn against pursuing that approach .
but it is not the only one - other examples include algeria , bosnia and chechnya .
mr president , i would like to take this opportunity first and foremost to apologise to the members of this house as i will not be able to be present at this evening 's sitting .
mr president , i wish to compliment those who are still here after this long debate , in particular mr dini and mr santer .
that strength is still great in zimbabwe , still non-violent and still oriented towards peace and democratic solutions .
nonetheless , it is important and this new specialist force will be able to support the implementation of correct investigation procedures for sexual violence , particularly where the acts are carried out by those in uniform .
the prerequisite , however , is a balanced cohesion budget for the eu .
in germany where teaching and research form a single entity , it seemed to me a very obvious thought that the quality of a college or university can be judged only if its research achievements are evaluated at the same time .
madam president , there is still time to avert apocalypse and to launch an appeal for an immediate cease-fire to allow the vital dialogue between all the factions concerned .
i quote from a statement from the american treasury issued on 23 june : ‘swift is overseen by a committee drawn from major central banks , including the united states federal reserve , the bank of england , the european central bank , the bank of japan and the lead overseer , the national bank of belgium .
i therefore support the rapporteur 's proposal to reject the initiative and debate this important dossier after the treaty of lisbon has come into force .
that is why the union as such is rightly involved in public transport despite the fact that transport is usually a matter for local and regional authorities .
in this respect we face some very demanding challenges .
we need to tackle the issue of the need to perform a comprehensive approach involving analysis and treatment instead of further medicalising and pathologising life cycles .
to confine ourselves to the latest development within the council , the finnish presidency has prepared a questionnaire addressed to all the member states and to all the european institutions on the subject of `` women in the decision-making process '' .
we are therefore debating a topical issue which relates directly to public health and , of course , from our debate today , in the presence of the commissioner , i expect us to draw conclusions and commit to action .
this is not to give the impression that everything is inspired , managed and predetermined in brussels , but is aimed to ensure that this 27-times national , and therefore european , debate can be guided by wisdom and ambition .
the group of advisers can give advice , and it can even give advice about problems , but the decision has to be made by the legislator , and if the commission does not base its proposals on that fact , then there will be friction .
this applies to the european medicines agency , the european chemicals agency , the european aviation safety agency , the european maritime safety agency , the european railway agency , the european environment agency , the european centre for the development of vocational training , the european food safety authority , the community fisheries control agency and the community plant variety office , whose establishment plans are not specifically included in the documents accompanying the amendments .
labelling provides additional security for the consumer .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m .
the aim is not to replace existing relevant communications but rather to improve upon them by focusing on the overall general structure and knowledge-base that underpins the implementation of this environmental acquis .
it simplifies the treaties , makes external actions subject to international law , makes the eu more effective and transparent , more democratically legitimate , and creates the possibility of its citizens sharing in its decision-making .
the european union , once again , has demonstrated the huge strategic deficit on the question of palestine .
the commission 's approach is correct .
the situation is critical in the member states , and in greece in particular , as mr mandelson can see from the statistics submitted by the greek authorities on closures of textile companies and job losses .
the aim of local development is , in fact , to change the attitudes underlying development strategies .
the resources proposed by the commission and in the presidency 's compromise proposals will not result in a stronger rural development policy , which will give new opportunities and will introduce innovations so that the rural sector can approach the lisbon targets .
this one possibly has a rather ugly face : perhaps it should have a more beautiful one as we are talking about transparency .
friends from hungary , you represent your parliament and your country , a country recently welcomed into the family of democratic nations .
the resolution proposed by the liberals and also that proposed by the ppe are at least still available for voting on .
but there is some hesitation over the political conclusion .
question no 16 by pat gallagher ( h-0913/97 )
commission , council , i urge you to seek out the ayatollahs ' weaknesses , primarily in the interests of a more tolerable fabric of life for the iranian people and in the interests of the security of the jewish state of israel , not forgetting the arab world , and also the european union .
there has been a misunderstanding . let us accept that and move on .
and , although it is true that there have been agreements , it is also true that it has not been possible to conclude many other agreements .
the osce is seeking a new impetus .
that is very interesting , because a lot of the data certainly does not support that argument .
i am therefore voting in favour of the opinion concerning the petition signed by 15 000 people and delivered to parliament .
we should therefore like to raise this issue once again , and make it clear to audiences and to society during euro 2008 this month that this type of violence against women and girls is unacceptable .
what sort of rights are we talking about ?
this plays very much to the eu 's strengths as the world 's largest donor .
this solution ensures the transparency necessary for the application of the system and keeps existing guarantees for migrants .
thirdly , and this is something else we have to consider , there is the letter we have all received from the staff committee , which says that the committee on budgets ' proposals on fringe benefits could have serious consequences for staff .
while shareholders are selling their stock and making a gain , men and women are finding out that they will be the only ones to suffer from the situation .
i am rather afraid that such attempts may unleash powers that no one will be able to control .
mr mulder , i am most surprised to hear you now call for subsidies to be introduced in this prosperous market even though everybody says we have to dismantle subsidies !
however , although tobacco was prohibited , alcohol failed to get sufficient votes .
draft amending budget no 3/2006 ( vote )
i should once again like to thank mr el khadraoui and mr zīle , and i should also like to thank your committee .
i agree with this report in its encouragement of the creation , at a european level , of a system for the registration and supervision of credit rating agencies that issue ratings used within the eu , and its consideration of conditions for the use within the eu of ratings issued by agencies in third countries .
therapeutic communities have brought many youngsters back to life . prevention and cure go hand-in-hand with rehabilitation , reintegration and finally repressive policies , not just against small-scale trafficking but primarily against large-scale trafficking in hard drugs .
however , the most important and most difficult task is to change people 's habits .
the figure quoted by mrs gill on renewable energy only regards a special initiative .
if you now ask what damage results , that is , of course , difficult to say .
working on a draft constitution for europe was not a formalistic exercise , nor was it a whim or a luxury : rather , it was a response to a profound need in europe at this moment in its history .
romano prodi 's commission made commitments to the new member states without giving any consideration at all to emergencies , of which there have been several since then .
( ro ) mr president , the motion for a resolution relating to the case of the members of the former ukrainian government is needed to ensure respect for the basic principles of the european union , starting with respect for human rights .
children and young people are the most valuable asset we have for our future .
in this regard , i believe that the measures we should adopt should include an increase in monitoring and inspection and the clarification of quality indicators , and they should be of differing types , and , above all , it seems to me extremely important to ensure that training be established throughout the territory .
the eu can do more .
firstly i should like to thank the european parliament for the very encouraging and supportive approach taken on this matter .
as a producer , it is in my interest to restore consumer confidence in the production of cattle and sheep and related products .
the need now is for them to become aware of the beneficial effects on employment , because that is indeed the intention behind the single currency .
as there is currently no other legislation in force , it is proposed that the validity of this regulation be extended for an additional 18 months , until 1 january 2013 .
where operations have been carried out , lives have been saved and illegal immigration substantially reduced .
as the european union set out in its statement to the general assembly on 17 september : 'without a shared effort to accelerate progress towards the millennium development goals , rich and poor countries alike face a future of increased instability .
as a swedish eu critic , however , i myself represent a totally different view to mr bontempi and will therefore vote against the report .
the us admits the importance of finding global solutions to the problem .
i might add that the use of mechanically recovered meat is increasingly repugnant to consumers .
in line with the precautionary principle and with a view to protecting the environment , we must give a boost to setting biodegradability thresholds and to implementing new techniques for measuring the biodegradability of surfactants in detergents .
trade revenue can help increase the level of investments in basic services , but , in developing countries , particularly on the african continent , world trade plays far too small a role .
however , success hinges on a factor that has been absent up to now , and can not be replaced by any number of commission proposals : national ownership of necessary reforms by member states .
but i believe that what you said between the lines , as it were , is correct , and i agree with you there : we should not really be talking in terms of a crisis in the european union .
it was a great day for ireland and a great day for europe .
only through this close collaboration can the fight against breast cancer transcend ideological divides and personal rivalries .
i am therefore not surprised that the swiss now complain about brussels interfering in the internal affairs of their country .
as regards subsidies , i have to say that , although air transport is subsidised to a certain extent , it is much less so than urban , rail , sea and all other types of transport .
we think you are right to insist that member states eliminate special advertising and business structure restrictions and ensure fair and equal access to the professions , including eliminating geographic and demographic rules on entry .
my specific proposal is this : firstly , that if you go ahead and renew the pnr agreement on the basis of the third pillar , you only do so until 2007 .
that doctor said : ‘solvit has restored my confidence in the internal market’ .
the alde group thus wholeheartedly supports mr kohlíček 's proposal to reintroduce the first reading proposal .
i warmly congratulate mrs wallis on having made this work possible , as rapporteur , and of course i thank the secretariat of the committee on legal affairs for the work they have done and , in particular , as mrs wallis has also mentioned , the work of mr bray .
mr chairman , in conclusion i would like to bring up one technical issue .
turning to other questions , my group certainly welcomes the efforts made by the greek presidency on the question of temporary agency work , currently blocked through more political game-playing by particular member states .
the funds in question will not be needed until 1998 .
i wonder whether this is not due to the fact that despite the verified and documented abuses by the ruling party , the elections concerned have been recognised as the most democratic elections ever to have been held in the whole of ethiopia 's three thousand year history .
nor does it follow the line of the question raised by the commission itself in its communication of last september on a 'strategy for the outermost regions ' .
it is for that reason that a number of my amendments concentrate on the rights of consumers , the right of blind and deaf consumers and others at the margins while , of course , reinforcing the principle of universal service and adding some extra comments on it .
i approach it not like the former speaker from an anti-european perspective .
naturally , this is a recommendation the european union will make , but i will not hide from you the fact that debate on this specific question will always be very , very difficult and complex .
against this background , it is astonishing that the commission is proposing a eur 5 billion recovery package while , at the same time , it has not even used up the funds budgeted for structural policy .
what is needed is for broad market penetration to be brought about by a european framework directive .
given the current constraints in turkey , our turkish colleagues , some of whom are also here today amongst us , have really been very successful .
i believe , therefore , that this could be done .
the agenda is published in the session document which contains the same name and also on the european parliament 's website .
i do not think that we should concern ourselves with what is lacking at this stage .
the debate is closed .
they told me they want nothing to do with this condescension and breach of the principle of egality amongst citizens which , according to mrs kestelijn-sierens , would specifically assist women entrepreneurs and that they find the policy of compulsory quotas grotesque .
this was the first proposal for mobilisation of the solidarity fund within the 2010 financial period .
it can , of course , always be hoped that there will be developments as a result of which it will be possible at some time or another to remove the pkk from the list .
i am therefore very surprised at this omission and would ask that my presence on friday , 12 february be recorded .
mr putin 's election campaign was one of the factors underlying the intensification of the second of these wars , which is still being waged .
we have avoided inserting an equals sign , however notional , between an existing state and a terrorist movement .
in cases of operational disruptions in particular , we can not have some distant office making decisions ; competence must remain with the individual infrastructure operators and railway companies , so that normal train traffic can be resumed as quickly and as efficiently as possible .
we should also be dealing with the tax problems , as i said just now .
however , i am concerned that the commission might decouple the enp from the enpi budget , which will entail a substantial erosion of parliament 's powers of oversight and scrutiny .
the fact that we have been engaged in this process for a number of years now , and are not satisfied , must not prompt us to give up ; instead we must muster our courage and press on .
finally , any incentives to remain in work should , as a precondition , include safety valves to overcome any barriers which might prevent young people from accessing the labour market , especially at a time when unemployment has , unfortunately , soared to invisible heights .
thus , if they can not prevent natural disasters , they can attempt to anticipate them and alert the people , and above all they must minimise risk through responsible prevention policies .
this is also true of greece and turkey but there is now a negotiating framework for this . we must bide our time and ensure that this negotiating framework can operate , particularly bearing in mind the currently positive greek-turkish relations .
if it did , european farmers and consumers would have benefited so much more from the way that mentalities have rapidly changed for the better : towards moving on from costly , wasteful agriculture that destroys the countryside , towards agriculture that respects men and women , their work , the land and the environment .
it is perhaps a depiction of how the eu actually works best - without elected representatives and , in fact , without any people at all .
